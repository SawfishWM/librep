	variable, they're records with :name and :net-alias fields.
	This involved changing a few function names..

	* mail-dir-summary.jl: removed the address/alias distinction
	and added an edit command, this dumps you to a buffer

	(put, get): `rules' to access the messsage's plist
	(attribute): now just a synonym for `get'

1998-09-18  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	record is now a one-to-many mapping from keys to values.
	Currently used keys are :net (email addresses) and :name (real
	names)
	* mail-dir-summary.jl: fixed for the new database. Needs a lot
	of work to allow arbitrary fields to be manipulated

	rm-rule-function property was being called rm-rule-symbol in a
	lot of places

1998-09-17  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* read-mail.jl (rm-format-alist): the %D and %M formats don't
	do %02d formatting anymore, just %d

1998-09-13  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* ispell.jl (ispell-ignore-word-hook): new hook, called

	any words preceded by a backslash (i.e. TeX commands)

1998-09-12  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* buffers.jl (find-file): if the buffer's name would be null,
	look for the name of the parent

	buffer-file-name points to a directory puts it into Dired mode
	* dired-hooks.jl: use the read-, write-, and insert-file hooks
	instead of the find-file-hook. This allows the buffer to be

	* remote-ftp.jl (remote-ftp-command): now transparently
	reconnects when the server times out

	in prompts

	* windows.jl (enlarge-view): fix bug of not being able to
	enlarge minibuffer (unless more than two views are present)

	* prompt.jl: don't use set-status-message to display title.
	Instead insert the title at the beginning of the prompt,
	covered by a read-only extent (with prompt-title-face).
	Also enlarge the minibuffer to two lines temporarily if it's a
	single line (to avoid being clobbered by messages)

1998-08-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* yacc-mode.jl: new major mode, uses indented-text for yacc
	grammar, and embeds minor-major c-modes for all C regions
	* modes.jl (auto-mode-alist): added yacc-mode

	* send-mail.jl (send-mail-find-header): avoid the read-only
	header-separator

	* minor-major.jl (minor-major-mode, delete-minor-major-mode):
	new file, allows major-modes to be set for _regions_ of the
	current buffer (uses extents and the `catch-variables'
	property)

1998-08-27  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* buffer-summary.jl: don't print the minor-modes

	* modes.jl (mode-name, minor-mode-alist, mode-line-format): new
	variables

	function): new variables. When non-nil these completely
	override the prompt-complete and prompt-list-completions

	* shell.jl (shell-output-filter, shell-output-limit,
	shell-echos, shell-last-output): new variables
	(shell-filter): new function, the default output stream
	(shell-enter-line): uses telnet.jl's method: if at the end of
	the buffer, send everything after the position of the last
	output, otherwise resort to prompt-matching

	* telnet.jl: moved most of the funky output-filtering to
	shell.jl, password prompt grabbing is now done via the
	shell-output-filter variable. Also use the shell's send-line
	function exclusively

	view or a buffer

	* rm-thread.jl: fix the `date' sort key

	* read-mail.jl (rm-open-mailboxes): list of buffers, this stops
	buffers being gc'd while they're still in use (references to
	buffers are by marks, which are `weak' references)

	`rm-rule-X' to `rm-rule:X', added a `(body REGEXP)' rule to
	search the body of the message

Sun May 31 12:06:02 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

Fri May 22 10:15:28 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* cvs.jl, dired.jl, gdb.jl, help.jl, isearch.jl, keymap.jl,
	loadkeys.jl, rcs.jl, send-mail.jl, tex-mode.jl,
	texinfo-mode.jl: altered uses of next-keymap-path to take
	account that it's now a function not a variable

	* keymap.jl (map-keymap): new function, allows a function to be
	mapped (recursively) over all existing key bindings
	(print-keymap): defined in terms of map-keymap
	(where-is): new command, searches the key binding hierarchy for
	a specified command (using map-keymap)
	* help.jl: bind where-is to `Ctrl-h w'

	* c-mode.jl: lots of minor fixes, hopefully correcting a lot of
	mis-indentation; some problems still exist

Wed May 20 17:34:48 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* buffer-summary.jl: removed bs-buffer variable, now find or
	create *buffers* buffer dynamically. This helps garbage
	collection

Sun May 17 19:51:41 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* rm-misc.jl (rm-forward): new method of deleting trailing
	blank lines, this one seems to work

	* send-mail.jl (send-mail-show-output): new variable, when t
	output from sendmail is always displayed. Replaces
	sendmail-debug

Sat May 16 23:39:14 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* mail-dir.jl (mail-dir-auto-expand-aliases): deleted; the user
	has to put the function in the mail-send-hook manually now
	(add-mail-alias, add-mail-address): protect against adding null
	addresses

	* mail-headers.jl (mail-insert-list): be more intelligent when
	finding the depth to indent continuation lines to--either the
	column following the name of the header, or the current
	indentation if inserting in a continuation line

	* sm-mail-dir.jl: bind `Ctrl-c Ctrl-x' to expand any mail
	aliases in the message's headers (in send-mail mode)
	(sm-mail-dir-expand-aliases): this now seems to work, and is
	called expand-mail-aliases. It's not added to mail-send-hook,
	but is suitable for use in this hook. Given an interactive
	decl. so can now be called as a command

	* edit.jl (save-restriction): when restoring the original
	restriction, unrestrict the buffer if there was no original
	restriction or it's now invalid

Fri May  8 13:03:43 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* windows.jl (other-view): only enlarge an existing view when
	the desired size is less than its current size

	* cvs.jl (cvs-show-output-buffer): only call shrink-view-if-..
	when the real current buffer isn't the *cvs* buffer to avoid an
	annoying effect

Wed May  6 16:23:46 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* rcs.jl, rcs-hooks.jl, dired.jl, dired-hooks.jl: use autoload
	mechanism to load -hooks files, rcs-mode also autoloads its
	main keymap

	* cvs.jl (cvs-keymap): now autoloaded

	* lisp.jl (autoload-variable): new function
	* find-autoloads.jl: ignores defmacro, but understands defvar

Tue May  5 10:28:10 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* html-style.jl (html-style-header): optional NO-HEADING arg
	suppresses the initial heading

	* cvs.jl (cvs-option-alist): remove default options, should be
	up to the user

	* cvs.jl (cvs-update-file-list): split the completion function
	out into cvs-update-finished, this function takes a single
	argument, the _value_ of the hook to call. This is required
	due to the asynchronicity in relation to the caller of
	cvs-update..

Mon May  4 12:12:22 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* cvs.jl (cvs-update-file-list): call cvs-after-update-hook on
	completion
	(cvs-undo-modification): ensure that buffers aren't reloaded
	until _after_ the update has completed

	* info.jl: use the buffer-status-id to display the current node
	name, not the mode-name

Sun May  3 12:22:27 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* read-mail.jl (rm-next-page, rm-previous-page): detect top and
	bottom of buffer properly, not just when the cursor is at the
	top or the bottom

	* buffer-summary.jl: use the standard read-only/modified
	symbols (as in the status line). Removed the `-' synonym for
	the `%' command

	* init.jl, compiler.jl: don't use version-and-build-string
	anymore, but use build-id-string instead

Thu Apr 30 10:43:36 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* buffer-summary.jl (bs-print-item): substitute `Fundamental'
	for `Generic'

	* help.jl (lisp-documentation-file): name of the file
	containing the Lisp library's documentation strings
	(add-documentation, get-documentation): use the
	lisp-documentation-file for Lisp documentation

	* dired.jl (dired-do-copy, dired-do-rename): new commands

	* summary.jl (summary-update, summary-update-item): mark the
	buffer as unmodified before calling the after-update vector
	(summary-command-items): new function, copied from part of
	cvs-command-get-files. This returns a list of items for a
	command to manipulate in some way
	* cvs.jl (cvs-command-get-files): call summary-command-items

	* cvs.jl (cvs-option-alist): added -v option to status
	(cvs-keymap): bindings of `t' and `T'
	(cvs-tag, cvs-tag-directory): new commands

Wed Apr 29 09:39:40 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* maildefs.jl (mail-summary-lines): renamed as
	mail-summary-percent, now defines the percentage of the window,
	not the number of lines
	* read-mail.jl (rm-configure-views): changed for above switch

	* read-mail.jl (rm-summary-format-alist): new conversions `b',
	`n' and `N'.
	(rm-status-format): format string for part of status line
	(read-mail-folder): don't expand folder name so much
	(rm-fix-status-info): cache status line formatted text
	(rm-invalidate-status-cache): for above

	* info.jl (info-read-dir): use insert-file instead of
	read-file-into-buffer. This doesn't set the buffer's file-name.
	Also set the file-name to nil, and the buffer as unmodified.
	(info-prompt): rename list-fun to info-list-fun since it's a
	dynamic variable
	(info-list-menu-items): search from the restriction start, not
	the cursor position

Tue Apr 28 16:05:44 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* read-mail.jl: use the new buffer-status-id variable to
	display current message number with the buffer name

	* cvs.jl (cvs-undo-modification): use cvs-revert-filenames
	instead of doing it inline

Mon Apr 27 10:21:09 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* buffers.jl (buffer-file-modtime): has permanent-local
	property

	* cvs.jl (cvs-commit-callback, cvs-revert-filenames): files
	should revert after being committed now

Sun Apr 26 13:39:17 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* buffers.jl: call (window-list), instead of variable
	window-list
	* loadkeys.jl, loadmenus.jl, server.jl: use make- and
	delete-window instead of open- and close-window
	* windows.jl (window-list, window-closed-hook, open-window,
	open-window-on-display, close-window): deleted

	* buffers.jl (mildly-special-buffer): deleted this variable
	(kill-buffer): don't destroy-buffer, just remove it from all
	buffer-list's. Moved remove-buffer into this function
	(bury-buffer): use mapc, and fixed to handle views as well as
	windows
	(add-buffer): moved here from windows.jl
	(rotate-buffers-forward, rotate-buffers-backward): deleted
	(find-file): check if the file being opened has changed, if
	it's already buffered
	(check-changes, save-some-buffers): don't look for
	special-ness, but whether the buffer has no file-name
	* windows.jl (add-buffer, remove-buffer): deleted
	* loadkeys.jl: remove references to rotate-buffers-forward and
	rotate-buffer-backward 

	* modes.jl (kill-mode): renamed as fundamental-mode, since this
	is what it really does, given an interactive decl

	* compile.jl (compile-parse-errors): fix line numbers being out
	by one

	* buffer-menu.jl, compile.jl, compiler.jl, cvs.jl, debug.jl,
	disassembler.jl, gdb.jl, help.jl, info.jl, init.jl, keymap.jl,
	miranda.jl, prompt.jl, rcs.jl, read-mail.jl, send-mail.jl,
	shell.jl, summary.jl, telnet.jl: various fixes for loss of
	buffer-special functions, etc.

	* buffers.jl (open-buffer): always call add-buffer, not just
	when having to create the buffer

	* windows.jl (add-buffer, remove-buffer): rewritten using mapc
	instead of iteration. add-buffer won't add the buffer if it's
	already in the view's list

	* cvs.jl (cvs-buffer): variable pointing to the summary buffer
	(cvs-update-file-list): install a temporary minor mode whilst
	updating (the mode's called cvs-update)
	(cvs-buffer-p): macro to test if the current buffer is the
	summary buffer
	(cvs-summary-select-other-view): fixed

Sat Apr 25 14:38:38 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* cvs.jl (cvs-command): handle the `*cvs*' buffer not existing

Fri Apr 24 14:02:50 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* cvs.jl: support for calling CVS commands asychronously,
	currently, cvs-update, cvs-log, cvs-status,
	cvs-commit-callback and cvs-diff-cvs take advantage of this

Thu Apr 23 12:02:57 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* cvs.jl (cvs-summary-clean): implemented this command

Wed Apr 22 17:22:48 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* windows.jl (open-view, close-view): deleted, replaced by
	split-view and delete-view in views.c
	(close-other-views): renamed delete-other-views
	* buffer-menu.jl, buffer-summary.jl, loadkeys.jl, prompt.jl,
	read-mail.jl: replace open-view by split-view, and close-view
	by delete-view, etc

Tue Apr 21 11:48:59 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* cvs.jl (cvs-diff-backup, cvs-undo-modification): implemented
	these commands

	* compile.jl (compile-parse-errors, next-error): rewrote most
	of these functions. Now tracks changes of directory while
	compiling (see compile-{push,pop}-directory-regexp variables,
	by default set up for GNU make)

	* cvs.jl (cvs-command): use (message ... t) instead of (format
	t ...) to display calling CVS message

Mon Apr 20 00:20:06 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* cvs.jl (cvs-commit-directory): new command, bound to `C'

	* cvs.jl (cvs-summary-mode): defined this function to provide
	the mode's documentation
	(cvs-command-get-files): in the summary buffer, when no files
	are marked, select prefix-arg files, not just one

	* find-url.jl (find-url-alist): deleted the http: method since
	it's covered by the default action

Sun Apr 19 15:30:07 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* cvs.jl, autoload.jl: a rudimentary CVS mode, inspired by
	pcl-cvs.el. Most important shortcoming is lack of control over
	which revisions are manipulated

	* dired.jl, summary.jl (dired-mark-if): moved from dired.jl to
	summary.jl, and renamed as summary-mark-if

Sat Apr 18 00:19:49 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* buffers.jl (revert-buffer): attempt to leave the cursor in
	its original position (by saving the surrounding lines, then
	searching for them). Also added a new optional argument, FORCE,
	which prevents confirmation from the user being asked for

	* rcs.jl (rcs-command): when REREAD-BUFFER is t, use
	revert-buffer to achieve this

	* Makefile.in: use JADELISPLIB and JADEDOCFILE to allow proper
	compilation of Lisp files before they've been installed

Fri Apr 17 14:18:22 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* tilde.jl (tilde-file-handler): handle the expand-file-name
	operation separately now, simplify the stuff after the tilde
	expression

Wed Apr  8 11:59:44 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* pwd-prompt.jl (pwd-prompt): use unwind-protect to ensure that
	the old glyph table is re-established

	* telnet.jl (telnet-grab-passwords): variable controlling
	whether to scan for password prompts, and if so, for how long
	after the start of the session
	(rlogin-program): new variable
	(telnet): new optional arg, USE-RLOGIN
	(rlogin): new command
	(telnet-filter): don't try to be clever when telnet-echos is
	non-nil
	(telnet-send-line): when telnet-echos is non-nil, delete input
	immediately after it's sent

Tue Apr  7 10:20:02 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* telnet.jl (telnet): specifying a port number now works

	* telnet.jl (telnet): spawns a telnet session in a buffer

	* pwd-prompt.jl (pwd-prompt): prompts for a string
	confidentially. Does this by hacking (literally) prompt.jl to
	use a special glyph table

	* find-url.jl (find-url-telnet, find-url-mailto): new functions

	* compiler.jl (compile-file): slightly modified comment
	prefixed to compiled files

	* loadkeys.c: bound "Ctrl-x Ctrl-Meta-f" to find-url

	* shell.jl (shell-command-on-area): don't popup *shell-output*
	buffer if it's totally empty

	* find-url.jl (find-url): new file, new command, it allows urls
	to be followed. By default, http urls are redirected to
	netscape, and file ones are loaded into the editor. ftp and
	telnet (and others?) are still to be implemented

Sun Apr  5 20:13:42 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* buffers.jl (save-some-buffers): print a message if no
	modified buffers exist on entry

	* compiler.jl (comp-get-lambda-vars): made into a macro; now
	uses filter instead of a combination of mapcar and delq

	* compiler.jl (comp-compile-funcall): open code constant lambda
	expressions; this isn't going to be useful with existing code,
	but it might be in the future (and it's painless..)

Sat Apr  4 19:39:28 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* file-subst.jl: provide file-subst
	* html-style.jl: require file-subst

	* edit.jl (mouse-select-drag-block, mouse-select-drag-rect):
	new functions, calling mouse-select-drag, but not until they've
	set or cleared the rect-blocks flag
	* loadkeys.jl: bound Ctrl-Mouse events to mark rectangles

Fri Apr  3 12:38:54 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* fill.jl (fill-area): hopefully fixed the bug erroneously
	leaving single words on the last line of the buffer

Thu Apr  2 10:28:19 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* rm-misc.jl (rm-forward): fix deletion of trailing blank lines

Wed Apr  1 00:47:04 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* html-style.jl: simplified the default style a lot

	* compiler.jl (comp-compile-mapc): for mapc calls whose
	function argument is a constant lambda expression, do the
	looping in byte code and open-code the function call. All other
	mapc calls use the mapc opcode as before

	* html-style.jl: new file, code to work with file-subst.jl to
	create web pages to a common style

Tue Mar 31 00:42:31 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	the start of a file name. Understands both ~/ and ~USER/

	* shell.jl: fix TERMCAP entry

	* read-mail.jl, rm-misc.jl, rm-output.jl: more fixes to
	ensuring correct separation between messages

	* loadmenus.jl: change for new operating-system variable; I
	don't know why I keep this file...

	* lisp.jl (file-name=): no longer a primitive, this now works
	by comparing canonical file names

	* init.jl: minor changes to order of loadup; also catch all
	errors when executing site-local and user config files

	* info.jl (info-find-node): fixed some bugs

	* help.jl (get-documentation, add-documentation): new
	functions, these replace the old get-doc-string and
	add-doc-string primitives

	* file-subst.jl: new file, provides a method of generating
	arbitrary text files from input templates. Allows the full
	expressiveness of Lisp to be used in expansions. I use this to
	build all my web pages using the same style

	* environ.jl (getenv, setenv): new file, these functions used
	to be primitives, now they use the process-environment variable

	* edit.jl: use (eq window-system 'x11) to test for X

	* dired.jl: added `% d' and `% m' commands. Also cleaned up
	some code. Needs more commands

	* compiler.jl: support for comp-transform property in
	functions, basically a method for specifying a source code
	transformation (i.e. macro) to compile the form

	* buffer-summary.jl (bs-print-item): handle oversized fields
	more elegantly

	* add-log.jl, buffers.jl, compile.jl, compiler.jl, dired.jl,
	dump.jl, find-autoloads.jl, gdb.jl, gzip.jl, info.jl,
	mail-dir.jl, maildefs.jl, miranda.jl, print.jl, prompt.jl,
	rcs-hooks.jl, rcs.jl, read-mail.jl, rm-output.jl, send-mail.jl,
	shell.jl, tags.jl: changes for new file handling (mainly to
	support file names relative to the current buffer; includes
	replacing uses of the file-name-concat function by
	expand-file-name, and ensuring that subprocesses get given
	local-file-name's)

Mon Mar 23 09:29:30 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* read-mail.jl, rm-misc.jl, rm-output.jl: was checking if
	number of lines in buffer is zero to see if the file's
	empty---there's always at least one line (doh!)

	* read-mail.jl (rm-append-inbox): set rm-current-msg-index to
	zero if we're adding the first message in the folder

Fri Mar 20 13:49:28 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* dired.jl (dired-print): changed the output format slightly
	(dired-delete, dired-execute-end): don't confirm deletion one
	file at a time; record all files to be deleted, then use
	map-y-or-n-p

Thu Mar 19 09:55:21 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* info.jl (info-prompt): fix validation function not
	constructing the list of options
	(info-menu): when searching for entered menu name, search case
	insensitively

	* mail-headers.jl (mail-parse-atom): a few minor fixes to allow
	null strings, comments and addresses to be recognised

Mon Mar 16 15:48:28 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* read-mail.jl, rm-misc.jl, rm-output.jl: miscellaneous fixes
	to make the message at the end of the file be handled better;
	also changed how the \n\n separator is inserted between
	messages

	* compiler.jl, disassembler.jl, bytecodes.jl (op-filter,
	op-macrop, op-bytecodep): new opcodes

	* buffers.jl (save-some-buffers): rewritten using map-y-or-n-p
	and filter

	* prompt.jl (map-y-or-n-p): new function, apply y-or-n-p to a
	list of inputs

Sat Mar 14 16:06:25 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* read-mail.jl (rm-summary-print-item): use the all-new and
	enhanced format function to do all dirty work

	* summary.jl (summary-mark-item, summary-mark-delete): when
	called interactively these now use the prefix arg to find how
	many items to mark. Also s-mark-delete just calls s-mark-item

	* summary.jl (summary-assoc-item-function): new variable
	(summary-unmark-all): new command, bound to "U"
	(summary-execute): always ignore the `mark' symbol, also ensure
	that any skipped symbols are preserved in the list of those
	pending
	(summary-mark-line, summary-map-marked-items): new functions
	for working with marked items

	cursor not being on an item gracefully

	* dired.jl (dired-functions, dired-cursor-column): add an

	* init.jl: load dired-hooks

	* buffers.jl (find-file-hook): renamed as after-read-file-hook.

	* rcs.jl, rcs-hooks.jl (rcs-set-default-branch): new command,
	bound to "Ctrl-x v b", sets the default branch of the file to
	either the currently checked out revision, or the highest (with
	a prefix arg)

Thu Mar 12 20:23:28 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* mail-headers.jl (mail-quote-phrase, mail-format-address): now
	does proper quoting of phrases when necessary

	* mail-dir-summary.jl (mds-alias-functions,
	mds-address-functions): bind the mds-compose-mail-to-item
	function to the select tag (i.e. pressing RET)
	(mds-compose-mail-to-item): make ITEM an argument, but infer
	the IN-CC arg from current-prefix-arg

Wed Mar 11 09:30:52 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* maildefs.jl (mail-atom-re): fixed this to be [almost] exactly
	what RFC-822 specifies. It's now defined exclusively instead of
	inclusively (how foolish..)

	* mail-headers.jl (mail-parse-address): build the various
	regexps each call, this works even when mail-atom-re changes
	behind our back

Tue Mar 10 20:24:28 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* shell.jl (shell-mode-kill, shell-start-process): when a
	shell-process exists, check that it's in use before complaining

	* tags.jl (find-tag, visit-tags-file): new file, new commands.
	Currently only supports etags generated TAGS files
	loadkeys.jl (global-keymap): find-tag bound to M-.

	persist across calls to the mail reader
	(rm-kill-subject): new command (bound to `k') that deletes all
	messages with the same subject as the current message
	(rm-pipe-message): new command, calls shell-command-on-area for
	the current message (bound to `|')

	previously have been cached for the message in question
	(rm-tag-cached-p, rm-invalidate-tag): cache utilities
	(rm-current-message-end): no longer uses the position of the

	outputs X-Jade-Cache-v1 containing persistent items in the
	message's cache

	read-mail" to work as you would expect

	* buffer.jl (maybe-save-buffer): fixed

	* compiler.jl (comp-max-inline-depth): variable controlling
	maximum nesting of open-coded functions

	by a particular lambda list
	(comp-compile-inline-lambda): open-codes a function call, used
	both for constant lambda expressions as the first element of
	function applications, and for inlining defsubst declared
	functions
	(comp-compile-inline-function): defsubst puts this into the
	compile-fun property of all inline functions

	* lisp.jl (defsubst): new macro, define an inline defun

Fri Feb 27 12:26:14 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* edit.jl (goto-view-line): new function, bound to Meta-r.
	Moves the cursor to the start of a line displayed in the
	current view (similar to C-l, but moving the cursor, not the
	display)

	* loadkeys.jl (global-keymap): changed M-> and M-< bindings

Wed Feb 25 10:07:41 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* rcs.jl (rcs-init-file): don't check out zero length files, if
	the file actually is zero bytes in the repository we'll go into
	an infinite loop

	* c-mode.jl, xc.jl: integrated the XC code with the standard C
	mode. Of course, there's still a lot of improvements to be made
	and bugs to be fixed..

	* keymap.jl (read-event): rewritten to use the minibuffer to
	display the prompt, this means that the cursor also appears in
	the minibuffer. Also, easier to handle cleanup
	(describe-key): handle chained bindings better

	* rcs.jl (rcs-display-diffs): renamed as rcs-compare-revisions,
	when called interactively with a prefix arg, the revisions will
	be prompted for

	(rcs-verify-buffer, rcs-register-buffer, rcs-check-in-buffer,
	rcs-lock-buffer, rcs-view-revision, rcs-revert-buffer): removed
	the BUFFER argument, all now operate on the current buffer

	* read-mail.jl (rm-display-current-message): when highlighting
	headers ensure that any continuation lines are also included

	* maildefs.jl (mail-display-summary): slightly changed
	semantics -- set to `bottom' means display summary at bottom of
	display, otherwise non-nil means display at top, nil means
	don't display (as before)

	* read-mail.jl (rm-configure-views): new function to set up the
	window configuration, two views mail and summary

	* summary.jl (summary-highlight-index): highlight to the end of
	the line or the right edge of the display, whichever is greater

Sun Feb 22 15:51:24 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

Thu Feb 19 00:02:49 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lisp-mode.jl (lisp-forward-sexp, lisp-backward-sexp): treat
	the three characters ` , @ as single quote (i.e. step over them
	when they occur at the start of a sexp)

	* backquote.jl: don't use (` X), (, X) and (,@ X), the Lisp
	reader now parses the usual syntax

	* edit.jl (save-restriction): changed to use normal backquote
	syntax
	(save-cursor): renamed save-excursion since it does actually
	save the current buffer as well as the cursor, this is close
	enough to the usual definition of save-excursion for me

	* rm-output.jl, text-mode.jl: change calls to save-cursor to
	call save-excursion

Wed Feb 18 23:20:34 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* backquote.jl: new file, provides pseudo-backquote operation.
	This file was taken from GNU Emacs 19.34 (originally by Rick
	Sladkey), with very minor modifications

	* edit.jl (auto-mark): now made buffer-local, i.e. each buffer
	gets its own auto-mark
	(goto-mark): added optional arg DONT-SET-AUTO which can inhibit
	setting the auto-mark before moving
	(save-restriction, save-cursor): now implemented using
	backquote, both have been improved, save-restriction now uses
	marks, both check that the buffer is still resident before
	reinstalling it
	(mouse-pos): new function
	(mouse-select): updated for line wrapping redisplay

	* buffers.jl (goto-mark, set-auto-mark,
	swap-cursor-and-auto-mark): moved to edit.jl

	wrapping redisplay

	* rm-misc.jl (rm-reply): accept null subject lines gracefully
	(rm-forward): minor changes, also don't put empty lines between
	the forwarded message and its delimiters

	* loadkeys.jl: removed mark-1, mark-2 and mark-3, and the key
	bindings to set and goto them

	* isearch.jl (isearch-accept): call set-auto-mark to do it's
	stuff instead of faking it

	* init.jl: load backquote on startup

	* help.jl (describe-function): updated for compiled bytecode
	objects

	* fill.jl (unfill-paragraph): new command, changes all newlines
	withing the current paragraph(s) to spaces

Mon Feb 16 20:29:06 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* replace.jl (replace-last-match): fixed; I was deleting the
	matched text before expanding it (doh!)

Thu Feb 12 18:51:44 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* dump.jl (dump-batch): options --enable-inline-strings and
	--disable-inline-strings
	(dump-defvar, dump-defconst): set the property
	variable-documentation not just documentation (which is wrong)

	* help.jl (documentation): fix for subr built-in variables

Sun Feb  8 14:46:12 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* windows.jl (scroll-next-view): new command, bound to
	"Ctrl-Meta-v", scrolls the next view in the window
	* loadkeys.jl (global-keymap): binding for above

	* rcs.jl (rcs-goto-buffer): display the RCS output buffer in a
	separate view, and call shrink-view-if-larger-than-buffer

Thu Feb  5 17:32:21 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* windows.jl (other-view): new interpretation of the LINES
	optional argument. If LINES is given then it always specifies
	the size of the returned view (even if the view already
	exists). If LINES is the symbol t, then the size of an already
	existing view is never changed. If LINES is nil the size of the
	returned view and the size of the current view are roughly
	equal.
	(enlarge-view, shrink-view): new functions to add or remove
	lines from the current view, shrink-view just calls
	enlarge-view with a negative argument
	(shrink-view-if-larger-than-buffer): new function to reduce the
	size of the current view to the number of lines in its buffer
	* loadkeys.jl (ctrl-x-keymap): "Ctrl-x ^" bound to
	enlarge-view, "Ctrl-x -" bound to shrink-view-if-larger...

	* read-mail.jl (rm-summary-select-item,
	rm-summary-execute-end): both call other-view with LINES set to
	t to prevent view resizing

	* shell.jl (shell-command-on-area): when displaying a new
	buffer, shrink the view to the buffer's size

	* help.jl (help-wrapper): macro to replace the help-setup
	function. This handles shrinking the view to the size of the
	final buffer, and leaving the cursor in the original view, not
	that of the help-buffer
	* help.jl, keymap.jl: all calls to help-setup translated to use
	help-wrapper

Wed Feb  4 13:00:03 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* read-mail.jl (rm-delete-current-message): was sometimes
	leaving a blank line at the start of mailboxes

	message not format

Sat Jan 24 17:11:56 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* keymap.jl (print-keymap): was initialising the array index
	variable one to high (and thereby accessing past the end of the
	array)

	* buffers.jl, gzip.jl, read-mail.jl, send-mail.jl: updated for
	new function names, write-buffer-contents, read-file-contents
	and insert-file-contents.

	* buffers.jl (find-file): absorbs all functionality of
	open-file, and gets a new optional arg DONT-ACTIVATE which can
	be used to prevent the new buffer being installed in the
	current view.
	(open-file): deleted
	(open-file-hook): renamed as find-file-hook

	* dump.jl: new file, provides dumping of compiled Lisp files to
	an assembler file that can be assembled and linked into a
	special "jaded" executable. Only forms that are ``constant''
	are dumped, the rest get put in a FILE.jld file that cmd_load
	knows when to look for

	* lisp.jl (autoload): when the executable contains dumped data,
	don't add autoload definitions for any files that were dumped
	(since they may overwrite the constant definitions), instead
	load the file there and then (unless it's already been loaded)

	* add-log.jl, buffers.jl, find-autoloads, gdb.jl, rcs-hooks.jl,
	rcs.jl, server.jl: use find-file instead of open-file

	* compiler.jl, gzip.jl, mail-dir.jl, rm-output.jl,
	send-mail.jl: use open-file and close-file instead of open and
	close

	* init.jl: now load autoloads.jl after loading windows.jl and
	buffers.jl (I can't remember why!?) Also cleaned up how the
	command-line-args are used, if a function is called via the -f
	option it's guaranteed that the next argument will be the car
	of the list

	* debugrc.jl: now catches all errors and prints them before
	resuming operation. On catching end-of-stream though it quits

	* text-mode.jl (indented-text-mode): explicitly give
	fill-prefix a buffer-local value, in case fill.jl hasn't made
	it automatically buffer-local yet

Tue Jan 20 14:28:45 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* mail-dir-summary.jl (mds-compose-mail-to-item): command
	(bound to "m") that composes a new mail message with the
	current item as the recipient (by default in the To: field,
	prefix arg means put it in the CC: header)

Mon Jan 19 18:22:52 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* compiler.jl (comp-compile-top-form): use defun and defmacro
	again now they can handle bytecode objects

Sun Jan 18 21:59:02 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* add-log.jl (changelog-mode): explicitly create buffer-local
	values of fill-prefix and fill-prefix-width, in case fill.jl is
	not yet loaded

	* lisp-mode.jl (lisp-backward-sexp): if an expression is
	preceded by #, move onto it.

	* disassembler.jl: only one entry point now: `disassemble',
	this handles single forms and function/macro definitions.
	Now by default it outputs to the buffer *disassembly*, and
	heads the text with some information about the byte code

	* compiler.jl: modifications for byte code subrs. Instead of
	compiling functions and macros to a lambda list, we compile
	them to a byte code object. Also don't print newlines between
	output forms

	* debug.jl: bind to print-escape, not print-escape-newlines

Thu Jan 15 12:38:46 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* edit.jl (paragraph-regexp): renamed as paragraph-separate,
	this is now a regexp that matches the beginning of a line that
	separates two paragraphs
	(page-regexp): renamed as page-start
	(forward-paragraph, backward-paragraph): totally rewritten,
	these work properly now. As with all other forward- and
	backward- functions, forward-paragraph find the character
	following the end of the paragraph, backward-paragraph finds
	the character at the start of the paragraph
	(mark-paragraph): renamed as paragraph-edges, this function now
	finds the beginning and end of the current COUNT paragraphs.
	Marks them as a block when called interactively.
	(transpose-paragraphs): does what you'd expect, bound to `Ctrl-x
	Ctrl-Meta-t'.
	(save-cursor): now uses a mark to store the position

	* fill.jl: renamed from fill-mode.jl, this file has been almost
	completely rewritten
	(fill-break-re): regexp defining where it's permissable to
	break lines (by default: space, tab, newline or form-feed)
	(fill-mode-active): what used to be fill-mode-p
	(fill-prefix, fill-prefix-width): variable defining the fill
	prefix of the buffer. A string or a function, see its
	documentation for details.
	(set-fill-prefix): new command (bound to `Ctrl-x .') that
	saves from the start of the line to the cursor as the fill
	prefix for the buffer
	(fill-area): new function to fill an arbitrary region of text.
	Handles a prefix at the beginning of each line
	(fill-paragraph): now calls fill-area
	(fill-check-line): rewritten (this is for auto-fill mode)
	(center-line, center-paragraph): moved from text-mode.jl,
	untested

	* tex-mode.jl (tex-mode): set paragraph-separate to include
	"$$" as well as the normal blank lines. Also configures the
	generic expression handling code to handle TeX syntax a bit
	better ($..$ as delimiters, comments, don't have an escape
	character.

	* text-mode.jl (text-mode-init): don't include underscores and
	hyphens in word syntax.
	(indented-text-mode): set fill-prefix to text-mode-fill-prefix
	(text-mode-fill-prefix): function to handle fill prefix as
	indentation of the previous line.
	(center-line, center-paragraph): moved to fill.jl

	* loadkeys.jl (global-keymap): `Meta-h' bound to paragraph
	edges
	(ctrl-x-keymap): `Ctrl-x Ctrl-Meta-t' bound to
	transpose-paragraphs, `Ctrl-x .' bound to set-fill-prefix
	
	* lisp.jl (function, return): new macros

	* summary.jl (summary-update-item): don't use save-cursor anymore,
	now that uses marks it screws things up

	* compiler.jl (comp-inc-stack): rewritten as a macro, and given
	an optional argument N.
	(comp-compile-constant): checks if FORM is nil or t, and uses
	the special opcodes if it is

	* add-log.jl, asm-mode.jl, buffer-menu.jl, buffers.jl,
	c-mode.jl, edit.jl, gdb.jl, lisp-mode.jl, modes.jl,
	read-mail.jl, rm-misc.jl, send-mail.jl, shell.jl, summary.jl,
	tex-mode.jl, texinfo-mode.jl, text-mode.jl, xc.jl: change calls
	to eval-hook to use call-hook instead Note that read-file-hook,
	write-file-hook, insert-file-hook, auto-save-hook,
	read-mail-delete-message-hook, mail-yank-hooks are all "or"
	style hooks

Wed Jan 14 18:02:21 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* bytecodes.jl, disassembler.jl: opcode changes for new
	exception handling
	* compiler.jl (comp-get-label-addr): returns the pc of a
	previously-set label
	(comp-compile-catch, comp-compile-unwind-protect,
	comp-compile-error-protect): modified for new exception
	handling mechanisms. error-protect renamed as condition-case.

	* isearch.jl, lisp-mode.jl, read-mail.jl, xc.jl: changed
	error-protect to condition-case

	* bytecodes.jl, compiler.jl, disassembler.jl (op-max, op-min):
	new instructions

	* mail-dir.jl: new file, provides an email directory, both of
	addresses to names, and aliases to addresses

	* mail-dir-summary.jl (list-mail-addresses, list-mail-aliases):
	new file, uses summary-mode to display the email directory
	information. Also allows interactive editing of the directory.

	* rm-mail-dir.jl: hooks to interface the mail-dir with
	read-mail mode. Adds a new command `+' when reading mail that
	allows the address of the sender to be added to the directory.
	Also has facilities for doing this (semi-) automatically

	* sm-mail-dir.jl: hooks for send-mail mode. Two new commands,
	`Ctrl-c a' inserts an address from the directory (in the style
	defined by mail-address-style); `Ctrl-c Ctrl-a' inserts an
	alias definition. Also has support (untested as yet) for
	expanding aliases automatically prior to a message being sent

Sun Jan 11 13:21:55 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* maildefs.jl (mail-format-address): function to create a string
	with name and address parts, formatted according to

	after-load-alist (see `load' command)

	* buffers.jl: reorganised this file so that similar functions

	(save-and-quit): optional arg NO-QUERY, when t don't bother
	asking whether any unsaved files should be saved.
	(before-exit-hook): hook called by save-and-quit before exiting.
	(split-line-indent): deleted this function
	(goto-line): moved to edit.jl

	* prompt.jl (prompt-from-list): new optional arg DONT-VALIDATE;
	when t no validation function is installed, and hence strings
	that aren't in the supplied list may be entered.

Fri Jan  9 11:09:51 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* replace.jl (query-replace-rest): still invoked the
	replace-regexp function which has been deleted.
	(query-replace-keymap): bound Ctrl-g to quit
	(replace-string, replace-all, query-replace): minor doc-string
	changes

Thu Jan  8 15:48:32 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* compile.jl: general clean-up. Removed the compile-command,
	compile-default-command dichotomy, instead compile-command is
	left global (any attempt to set it in a "Local Variables:"
	section will make a local value). Also made the grep command
	prompt for the whole command string, not just the arguments;
	grep-buffer has been made to work again.

Sun Jan  4 23:48:31 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	conventions

Sat Jan  3 21:03:48 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* keymaps.jl (km-print-list): when recognising
	next-keymap-path being set, check that the thing it's being
	set to is a list, before adding it to the list of maps to print

	* gdb.jl (gdb-output-filter, gdb-redisplay-frame): put the
	cursor at the indentation position of the line, not at the end.

Sun Dec 21 02:51:44 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* buffers.jl, info.jl: fix timestamp usage (now a cons cell)

	* buffers.jl (revert-buffer): delete the auto save file
	_before_ loading the original, to remove the annoying `auto
	save is newer..' message

Sat Dec 20 00:16:47 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* bytecodes.jl, compiler.jl, disassembler.jl (op-pos,
	op-posp): new opcodes, for `pos' and `posp' respectively

	* lisp.jl (pos-col, pos-line): new macros

	* buffers.jl (auto-save-file-newer-p, file-newer-than-file-p):
	both use the new function time-later-p to compare time stamps

Wed Dec 17 12:34:26 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* modes.jl (init-mode): fixed '-*-X-*-' not being recognised

Tue Dec 16 12:01:45 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lisp.jl (or, and): new macros, in place of the old special
	forms of the same name
	(prin1-to-string, read-from-string): both defined as macros
	instead of functions

	* compiler.jl (comp-compile-cond): optimise case where the
	last condition list has no action associated with it--just
	fall out the bottom with the condition itself as the value
	(comp-compile-or, comp-compile-and): deleted

Mon Dec 15 10:49:06 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* compiler.jl (comp-compile-while): now puts conditional branch
	at the top of the loop to reduce the number of branches
	executed, uses the new opcode jpt

Sun Dec 14 15:47:25 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* Makefile: now compiles the Lisp files in two runs; the first
	uses the compiler to bootstrap itself, the second uses the
	compiled compiler to build everything else
	* compiler.jl (compile-compiler): small function to aid the
	above process

	* rectangle.jl (insert-rectangle, copy-rectangle,
	delete-rectangle, cut-rectangle): new file, replacing
	src/editrect.c. The functions have slightly different names,
	but not much has changed
	* edit.jl: change all calls to X-rect to be X-rectangle

	* Many changes to almost all files, adapting to the changes
	mentioned under the same date in src/ChangeLog. There's sure
	to be some fallout still to be fixed.

	split-line, goto-start-of-buffer, goto-end-of-buffer,
	top-of-buffer, bottom-of-buffer): new functions

	* maildefs.jl (mail-default-headers): Added an "X-Mailer"
	line
	(mail-summary-lines): reduced to eight
	(mail-parse-list, mail-parse-group, mail-parse-atom): the
	second and third functions are new, split off from
	mail-parse-list. It's now possible to read "groups" of
	expressions---things not separated by commas. A new optional
	arg to mail-parse-list controls this
	(mail-get-header): option to read a list of groups, not a list
	of comma-separated expressions
	(mail-insert-list): option to suppress comma-separators

	* send-mail.jl (mail-setup): now puts the subject immediately
	after the recipients. Also inserts the REFERENCES arg as a
	list of groups

	* rm-misc.jl (rm-reply): read and generate the "References:"
	header

Tue Nov 25 12:01:51 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* edit.jl (delete-blank-lines): rewritten to be compatible
	with Emacs' command of the same name, remove the infinite
	loop bug as well

	* summary.jl: new optional action `current'; if this is
	provided by the back-end it should return the index of the
	currently selected item

	* read-mail.jl (rm-display-current-message): new optional arg
	no-summary-update; controls whether or not to update the
	current summary item
	(rm-delete-messages): fixed some bugs, also now tracks how
	many messages have been moved through, so that when it has
	finished the current message is as close as possible to the
	current message on entry
	(rm-summary-current-item, rm-summary-functions): provide a
	`current' action

Fri Nov 21 12:27:10 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* compiler.jl: change '%' to use op-rem and 'mod' to use op-mod
	(comp-compile-transitive-relation): new function to compile
	>, >=, <, and <=. Needed since these functions can now take
	more than two arguments	

	* disassembler.jl: Update for op-mod/op-rem stuff

	* compiler.jl (compile-file): emit a validate-byte-code form
	* bytecodes.jl (bytecode-major, bytecode-minor): define
	instruction set described

Thu Nov 20 19:07:24 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* info.jl (info-find-node, info-read-dir): fixed a couple of
	minor bugs

Wed Nov 19 10:32:03 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* miranda.jl (miranda): new command; runs a Miranda session in
	the other view, prompting for the script to use beforehand.

	* summary.jl (summary-add-pending-op): now dispatches the
	function vector `after-marking'
	(summary-mark-delete): doesn't dispatch `after-marking' since
	the above change takes care of it
	(summary-quit): only bury the current buffer if the function
	vector `on-quit' doesn't exist; otherwise the `on-quit'
	function must handle everything

	* buffer-summary.jl (bs-quit): new function, bound to the
	summary's `on-quit' vector
	(buffer-summary): don't use goto-buffer to install the
	summary, to avoid the buffer-list being modified just use
	set-current-buffer
	(bs-select-item, bs-select-two-views): don't bury-buffer the
	summary, just call bs-quit
	(bs-mark-save): don't call summary-next-item, it's now called
	indirectly by add-pending-op (and the `after-marking' vector)

	* buffers.jl (open-buffer): new optional arg ALWAYS-CREATE.
	When t, an already-existing buffer is never returned.

	* compiler.jl (comp-warning): call add-buffer, if necessary,
	to add the compiler output buffer to each views list of buffers
	* gdb.jl, info.jl, rcs.jl, send-mail.jl, shell.jl: use
	open-buffer not make-buffer to create buffers; ensuring they're
	in the buffer-lists of all views.

	* prompt.jl (prompt-for-file): new optional arg HISTORY-LIST

	* maildefs.jl (prompt-for-folder): new function to prompt for
	a mail folder; uses its own history list and fills in defaults
	sensibly.

	* read-mail.jl (rm-next-undeleted-message,
	rm-previous-undeleted-message): commands to remove some of the
	overloading on rm-next-message and rm-previous-message
	(rm-next-message, rm-previous-message): the arg
	DONT-SKIP-DELETED has had the DONT- removed, and therefore the
	meaning reversed
	(rm-keymap): bind "s" to rm-output
	(read-mail-folder): use prompt-for-folder
	(rm-command-with-folder, rm-command-in-folder): macros to call
	a command in the folder buffer, used by rm-summary-keymap

	* rm-output.jl (rm-output): new command to save the next COUNT
	messages to another folder. Special action is taken if the
	destination folder is currently in a buffer; even more special
	action occurs if this buffer has read-mail-mode as its major
	mode (the new messages are added to the buffer's list of
	message structures). This hasn't really been tested yet.
	
Sun Nov 16 01:27:32 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* edit.jl (mouse-select): now handles views properly, i.e.
	activate the view that the mouse was clicked in

Thu Nov  6 15:37:27 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* print.jl (print-buffer, print-buffer-to-file,
	print-buffer-to-printer, print-area, print-area-to-file,
	print-area-to-printer): commands to print text, by default
	using the GNU `enscript' command.

	* prompt.jl (prompt-for-string): START arg wasn't being used
	correctly.

Mon Nov  3 01:33:51 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* edit.jl (mouse-select, mouse-double-select,
	mouse-select-drag): implement dragged selections
	* (global-keymap): new left mouse button bindings for
	drag-select

	* edit.jl (mark-block): does no extra refresh, it's not
	necessary anymore
	(mark-page): forces non-rectangular blocks

Sun Nov  2 11:01:25 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* read-mail.jl (rm-delete-messages): if we can't display the
	old current message; try to display the last message in the
	folder

Sat Nov  1 12:54:05 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* read-mail.jl (rm-build-message-struct, rm-update-flags):
	flags are now remembered via the "X-Jade-Flags-v1" header
	(rm-display-current-message): looks for a header matching the
	`mail-highlighted-headers' regexp, and highlights it
	* maildefs.jl (mail-highlighted-headers): regexp matching
	headers to highlight
	* rm-misc.jl (rm-reply, rm-forward): the callback functions to
	set the necessary flags work properly now

	* shell.jl (shell-command-on-area): new arg DELETEP which is
	passed to call-process-area. When INSERTP and DELETEP are both
	t output replaces the input region
	(shell-command-on-buffer): new command, similar to
	shell-command-on-area, but over the whole buffer.

	* loadkeys.jl (ctrl-x-keymap): bound `shell-command-on-buffer'
	to `Ctrl-x |'

Tue Oct 28 15:09:17 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* shell.jl (shell-command, shell-comand-on-area): commands to
	run shell commands in a user-friendly manner

	* loadkeys.jl (global-keymap): `M-!' and `M-|' bound to
	shell-command and shell-command-on-area respectively

	* rcs.jl (rcs-command): now directs error output to the *rcs*
	buffer no matter what the OUTPUT-STREAM parameter is

Sun Oct 19 19:20:49 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* loadkeys.jl: Bound sensible commands to "Insert" 
	(overwrite-mode), "Home", "End", "Prior" and "Next".

	* tex-mode.jl: `Ctrl-c Ctrl-c m' now inserts "\emph{}", fixed
	some bugs in tex-insert-end and tex-insert-braces

Thu Oct 16 15:33:35 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* rm-misc.jl (rm-reply): now looks for a "Reply-To" header as
	it should, and ensures that the initialised message is marked
	as being unmodifed

Wed Oct 15 23:15:43 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* send-mail.jl (mail-setup, send-mail-signature): now
	inserts "\n-- \n" before signatures as it should do, instead
	of "\n--\n"

	* read-mail.jl (rm-enforce-msg-separator): now assumes that
	the cursor is at the position to insert at

	* rm-misc.jl (rm-burst-message, rm-really-burst-message): now
	works properly, and handles both RFC-934 _and_ RFC-1153
	encapsulation schemes; seems to work ok..

	* prompt.jl (prompt-validate-from-list): ensures that the
	symbol `t' is returned, not just any old t value

Tue Oct 14 00:53:27 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* summary.jl (summary-update-item): now calls after-update
	function after doing its stuff

	* rm-misc.jl (rm-forward): now quotes "^-" properly
	(rm-burst-message): new command to unburst digests, should
	also handle sensibly forwarded messages

	* read-mail.jl (rm-enforce-msg-separator): new function to
	ensure "\n\n" exists when inserting new messages. Minor other
	fixes.

Sun Oct 12 21:06:30 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* modes.jl (generic-forward-exp, generic-backward-exp): two
	functions to provide expression handling for many common types
	of code. Installed by default in mode-forward-exp and
	mode-backward-exp.

Wed Oct  8 11:56:17 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* tex-mode.jl: initial revision; a simple mode for editing TeX
	and LaTeX. Derived from texinfo.jl with the bonus that
	tex-insert-braces works properly with negative args.

	* modes.jl (mode-alist): added tex-mode, some other minor
	changes

Tue Oct  7 12:10:23 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* rcs.jl (rcs-initial-comment): new variable controlling if an
	initial description of a registered file is prompted for
	(rcs-command): new optional argument OUTPUT-STREAM
	(rcs-register-buffer, rcs-check-in-buffer, rcs-lock-buffer):
	now allow the revision number to be specified (by typing 
	`Ctrl-u' before calling the command.)
	(rcs-view-revision): new command to display an arbitrary
	revision of the current buffer. Since stdout and stderr are
	linked when getting output from processes, this includes some
	unsightly header information.. (for now)

	* rcs-hooks.jl (rcs-keymap): moved here from rcs.jl so that the
	`Ctrl-x v ...' bindings work from startup

	* loadkeys.jl (global-keymap): `Ctrl-l' now bound to
	center-display not centre-display

	* prompt.jl (prompt-list-fold-case): new variable controlling
	whether or not prompt-complete-from-list and
	prompt-validate-from-list ignore case

	* info.jl (info-find-node): set info-file-name here; this
	seems to fix the weird history problem.
	(info-prompt): let prompt-list-fold-case be t

Sun Oct  5 22:04:56 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* read-mail.jl (rm-after-marking): won't move to the next
	message when it doesn't exist

Fri Oct  3 11:28:34 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* rm-misc.jl (rm-default-yank-function): fixed [yet] again,
	hopefully it now deletes only _blank_ trailing lines.. 

Thu Oct  2 00:06:54 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* read-mail.jl: don't search for mail-message-start in
	case-folding mode, this isn't a good idea

	* prompt.jl (prompt-complete-symbol): now regexp-quote's the
	word to be completed, this allows things like "let*" to work
	properly.

Wed Oct  1 17:04:00 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* summary.jl (summary-highlight-index): allows the
	highlighting of a single item (via the block marks).
	(after-update): new action

	* read-mail.jl: uses summary-highlight to mark the current
	message, not the "->" insertion.

	* send-mail.jl (send-mail-signature): now works properly when
	a signature already exists

	* read-mail.jl (rm-coalesce-visible-headers): when working on
	the headers end the restriction at the blank line following
	the last header. This prevents us hitting the end of the
	buffer when parsing the last header

	* rm-misc.jl (rm-default-yank-function): now properly deletes
	all trailing blank lines (not just empty lines)

	* summary.jl: added some more actions, after-marking,
	after-move, and on-quit. Removed the summary-after-execute
	hook since it was redundant.

	* buffer-summary.jl: defines an after-marking action that
	simply moves to the next item in the display

	* read-mail.jl: uses the after-marking action to move to the
	next message. If the current message was the one just marked,
	and rm-move-after-deleting is t select this message as well.
	Unfortunately this stops Ctrl-d moving backwards, have to fix
	this at some point

Sun Sep 28 13:58:33 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* buffer-summary.jl (bs-mark-save): advances to next item
	explicitly	

	* info.jl (info-prompt): don't define prompt-word-regexps,
	they should be okay by default

	* prompt.jl: now does history recall, three history lists by
	default: files, symbols and others. Also some more support
	for default values, stored at history item -1. Alsi fixed M-?
	command, and bound it to M-/ as well

	* summary.jl (summary-unmark-item): new optional arg
	MOVE-AFTER-P; whether or not to move to the next item
	(summary-update-item): don't trash cursor position anymore
	(summary-mark-delete): move to the next item explicitly

	* read-mail.jl (rm-message-count): variable storing the number
	of messages in the folder
	(rm-keymap): fixed `d' and `Ctrl-d' bindings, added `N' and 
	`P' bindings for moving through deleted messages, added `u'
	binding to unmark deleted messages
	(rm-last-folder): stores name of last read folder. Used when
	prompting for folders by read-mail-folder
	(rm-fix-status-info): function to set the minor-mode-names
	list to something describing the status of the current
	message; this isn't always updated when it should be yet
	(rm-summary-keymap): added `N' and `P' bindings, removed `d', 
	`DEL' and `Ctrl-d' bindings; handled by summary.jl

	* send-mail.jl (mail-setup): promoted to be a command. Now
	displays the mail buffer while asking if it's okay to lose its
	contents. Calls the text-mode-hook to enable auto-fill or
	whatever
	* loadkeys.jl (ctrl-x-keymap): bound `x' to mail-setup

	* rcs.jl (rcs-callback-with-description): Made the mode line
	description a lot shorter so that it fits in the window. Also
	invoke text-mode

	* rm-misc.jl (rm-forward): new argument ALL-HEADERS-P, takes
	it value from the raw prefix argument. Controls whether all
	headers or just those that are visible are included. Also now
	leaves the cursor in the ^To: field when no recipients are
	specified

	* read-mail.jl (rm-summary-keymap): calls rm-forward with the
	prefix-arg

	* fill-mode.jl (fill-paragraph): first attempt at this. Not
	particularly robust yet
	* loadkeys.jl (global-keymap): `Meta-q' bound to
	fill-paragraph

	* edit.jl (forward-word): doesn't trash its POS argument
	anymore.

Sat Sep 27 17:19:54 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* debug.jl (debug-entry): let print-escape-newlines be t

	* edit.jl (capitalize-word): works more intuitively when COUNT
	is positive now.

Fri Sep 26 15:21:52 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* read-mail.jl (rm-auto-next-message, rm-move-after-deleting):
	two new configuration variables
	(rm-next-page, rm-previous-page): commands for paging
	(rm-mark-message-deletion): switches message afterwards

	* read-mail.jl: Added reply, followup and forward commands.
	Removed the rm-always-with-X macros; now includes each command
	in the summary buffer that needs to run in the folder with
	rm-with-folder.
	(rm-in-folder): new macro
	(rm-summary-buffer): don't set mildly-special buffer, instead
	destroy-buffer it manually on exit

	* send-mail.jl (mail-setup): Many fixes. Changed a lot of mail-
 	symbol prefixes to send-mail-.
	Removed mail-buffer-in-use variable, inferred from whether the
	buffer is read-only

	* maildefs.jl (mail-yank-hooks, mail-reply-prefix,
 	mail-fill-column): new variables
	(mail-parse-list): returns the list in the order the items
 	actually occur
	(mail-find-header): can optionally specify the position to start
 	searching
	(mail-get-header): when LISTP is t, will look for multiple headers
 	of the same name
	(mail-insert-list): inserts a list of strings (separated by
 	commas), filled to the mail-fill-column. New lines are indented a
 	la RFC-822
	
	* edit.jl (forward-page,backward-page): don't move the cursor
 	by default; only when optional third arg is non-nil
	(capitalize-word): now has a COUNT arg -- which word to change
	(transpose-lines): new command
	(delete-blank-lines): new command

	* loadkeys.jl (ctrl-x-keymap): "Ctrl-o" bound to
 	delete-blank-lines, "Ctrl-t" bound to transpose-lines
	
Thu Sep 25 11:25:22 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* buffers.jl (fix-local-variables): fixed

	* maildefs.jl, read-mail.jl: try to be more intelligent when
	locating files

Wed Sep 24 11:13:28 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* maildefs.jl (mail-default-folder, mail-spool-files,
	movemail-program): new configuration variables. Note that
	movemail-program defaults to undefined.
	(mail-find-inboxes): returns a list of possible spool files
	for a particular mail folder

	* read-mail.jl: lots of new features; including the ability to
	read mail from spool files :-)  Lots of other things that were
	needed before the thing is usable.

	* buffers.jl (goto-buffer): new optional argument VIEW,
	defining the view whose buffer should be changed

	* add-log.jl (add-change-log-entry): now surrounds the mail
	address with angled brackets

	* edit.jl (after-kill-hook): called after changing the
 	kill-ring. Used under X11 to install the current-kill as the
 	primary selection
	(yank): won't yank the current selection if it's owned by Jade

Tue Sep 23 10:38:29 1997  John Harper  (john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk)

	* edit.jl (page-regexp, forward-page, backward-page,
	mark-page, restrict-to-page): page handling code. Pages are
	delimited by ^L
	* loadkeys.jl (ctrl-x-keymap): `Ctrl-p' is mark-page,
	`[' is backward-page, ']' is forward-page

	* edit.jl (save-cursor): macro to preserve the current cursor
	position
	* lisp-mode.jl: added indentation hint for save-cursor

	* add-log.jl (change-log-address, change-log-name): removed
	these two variables, they're replaced by user-mail-address and
	(user-full-name) respectively

Mon Sep 22 17:56:06 1997  John Harper  (john@gem.dcs.warwick.ac.uk)

	* loadkeys.jl (ctrl-x-n-keymap): new keymap, hooked to `Ctrl-x
	n'. Three commands "n" restrict to the current block, "w"
	unrestrict, and "p" restrict to a page (unimplemented) 

Mon Sep 22 00:13:43 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* read-mail.jl: changed the way summaries are used. Now a
	summary buffer always exists for each mail buffer, but maybe
	not displayed. Also unified some of the summary/mail buffer
	commands

	* maildefs.jl (mail-display-summary): new option; displays a
	summary as soon as a mail buffer is entered

	* compiler.jl: Correctly handles macros defined after they're
	used. The compiler now does two passes through each file it
	compiles --- the first builds the macro environment, the
	second does the actual compilation

Sun Sep 21 00:34:39 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* send-mail.jl: new file provides means to send mail messages.
	Currently only via sendmail(8) but hooks allow customisation.

	* maildefs.jl: central definition of all mail configuration
	variables, both for reading and sending, and a few mail
	utility functions. I've tried to keep the configuration
	options as compatible with Emacs as possible.

	* read-mail.jl: moved configuration parameters to maildefs.jl
	Also added a `replied' attribute to the message structure;
	it's set when the message contains a ^Replied: header; how can
	this be made compatible with VM?

	* windows.jl (close-view, close-other-views): make sure that
	the minibuffer view isn't closed

	* edit.jl (save-restriction): new macro, preserves the current
	buffer's restriction
	* lisp-mode.jl: Added indentation hint for save-restriction

Sat Sep 20 00:22:52 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* c-mode.jl, lisp-mode.jl: minor changes for new regexp code

	* gdb.jl (gdb-redisplay-frame): doesn't redisplay the frame in
	the current view when it's a buffer running gdb; uses the
	other-view instead

	* read-mail.jl (mail-header-name): this variable is defined in
	both read-mail.jl and send-mail.jl

	* read-mail.jl: a couple of fixes for the new regexp code,
	also fixed the rm-summary-update-current function

Fri Sep 19 00:49:09 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* info.jl: a couple of minor fixes for the new regexp code

Wed Sep 17 00:33:16 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* read-mail.jl: added support for deleting messages; also now
	handles an empty folder

	* summary.jl: added `execute-start' and `execute-end' function
	vectors that surround the guts of summary-execute.

Tue Sep 16 01:55:37 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* summary.jl: removed `n' and `p' keybindings, leave them for
	customisation by the deriving summary modes
	(summary-update, summary-update-item): print the newline
	themselves now.
	* summary.jl: various other stuff

	* read-mail.jl: works a lot better now, the summary buffer
	works properly, tracking the mail buffer..

	* buffer-summary.jl (bs-print-item): doesn't print newline

Sun Sep 14 00:21:53 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* windows.jl (other-view): new optional argument LINES, how
	many lines to give a newly created view. Does nothing in the
	case that the other view already exists.

	* buffer-summary.jl (buffer-summary-mode): new function that
	only contains a documentation string, for the mode.

Sat Sep 13 18:25:13 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* summary.jl: new file provides a generic menu system.
	Somewhat like the buffer-menu, it can be customised to suit
	whatever is being represented underneath. For example it will
	be able to provide the summary view of the mail reader

	* buffer-summary.jl: new file, replicates what buffer-menu.jl
	does, but using summary.jl for all the complex stuff.

	* read-mail.jl: first go at a basic mail reader. Currently it
	just parsers BSD style mailboxes, doesn't manipulate them at
	all.

Sun Sep  7 16:17:39 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* buffers.jl (read-file-into-buffer): now clears the buffer
	before doing anything

	* info.jl: much updated. Now uses the restriction feature,
	which in turn allows compressed files to be read. May also be
	less brain-damaged on Info files without tag tables.

Sat Sep  6 13:34:23 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* gdb.jl: Now displays source code in a different view of the
	current window; not a different window

	* rcs.jl (rcs-command): when rereading the buffer try to
	preserve the current cursor position (in a particularly
	non-bullet-proof manner)

	* rcs.jl (rcs-down-history, rcs-up-history): functions (bound
	to Meta-p and Meta-n respectively) used in the RCS callback
	buffer to recall the previously entered descriptions

	* All files are now under RCS control except for autoload.jl

Fri Sep  5 20:22:12 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* rcs.jl (rcs-version): fixed version numbers containing zeros
	not being recognized (regexp [1-9] not [0-9]!)

	* rcs-hooks.jl: new file, contains the function installed in
	the open-file-hook to recognize RCS controlled files. This
	loads rcs.jl when the first is found.

	* rcs.jl (rcs-file-p): moved to rcs-hooks.jl

Thu Sep  4 00:13:55 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* ring.jl (set-ring-head): was setting the next free position,
	not the previously accessed slot

	* prompt.jl: now displays messages in the status line after
	the title message

Wed Sep  3 20:39:34 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* bytecodes.jl, compiler.jl, disassembler.jl: Moved all byte
	code definitions from the compiler to bytecodes.jl. Also many
	of the opcodes have been renamed. op-setq and op-set
	(previously op-vsetc and op-vset) now leave the set value on
	the stack.

Tue Sep  2 23:43:49 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* compiler.jl: uses the new bind-{buffer,view,window} opcodes
	when compiling with-{buffer,view,window} special forms.
	Also modified compilation of unwind-protect to use the new
	binding mechanism

	* disassembler.jl: updated for new opcodes

Mon Sep  1 21:54:24 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* lisp.jl (if, when, unless): new macros, defined in terms of
	cond.

	* compiler.jl: fine-tuned the comp-compile-cond function; this
	now produces exactly the same code as the specialist if, when
	and unless functions. This is why they're now macros

Sun Aug 31 10:49:45 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* buffer-menu.jl: now understands multiple views; defines
	the commands `1', `2', and `o' accordingly. Still displays
	itself in the current view, no matter what that is.

	* compiler.jl (op-viewp, op-swap-view, op-current-view,
	op-swap2): new opcodes. `swap2' makes the top of the stack
	be beneath the next two stack values. `swap-buffer' now
	takes two arguments the buffer and the current view, and
	leaves them both on the stack. This is incompatible with
	old code!
	(comp-top-level-compiled): added `with-view' to the list
	(comp-compile-with-form): meta function to compile
	`with-window' and `with-view'.
	(comp-compile-with-buffer): uses new form of swap-buffer.

	* disassembler.jl (dis-opcode-vector): added new instructions.

	* edit.jl (forward-word, word-start): tries to handle hitting
	the start of the buffer more gracefully.

	* edit.jl (x11-block-status-function): new function, added to
	the `block-status-hook' when in X11. It sets up the current
	block as the current primary selection when necessary.

	* edit.jl (kill-ring, kill-string, killed-string): the new
	variable `kill-ring' is a ring-buffer (see ring.jl) holding
	killed text.
	(yank, yank-rectangle, yank-next): now use the kill-ring; 
	`yank-next' allows the contents of the kill-ring to be cycled
	through (but not with rectangles yet).

	* help.jl (help-setup): switches to the `other-view'

	* info.jl (info-prompt): uses the new minibuffer `prompt'
	instead of `prompt2'

	* init.jl: '(load prompt)' removed; the prompt functions are
	now autoloaded.

	* lisp-mode.jl: added hints for `with-view'

	* loadkeys.jl ("Meta-y"): bound to `yank-next'
	("Ctrl-x 0", "Ctrl-x 1", "Ctrl-x 2", "Ctrl-x o"): now work
	with views
	("Ctrl-x 4 ..."): now works in the `other-view'

	* ring.jl (make-ring, ring-capacity, ring-size, add-to-ring,
	get-from-ring, set-ring-head): New file, provides a ring-
	buffer type.

	* prompt.jl (prompt2): renamed as `prompt' and made to work
	with in the minibuffer view. Completions in a separate view.
	(prompt, prompt-for-directory, prompt-for-buffer,
	prompt-for-symbol, prompt-for-lisp, prompt-for-function,
	prompt-for-variable, prompt-for-command, prompt-for-string,
	prompt-for-number): all autoloaded now

	* prompt.jl (yes-or-no-p, y-or-n-p): moved here from ask.jl,
	both autoloaded anyway so makes no difference.

	* windows.jl (open-view, close-view, close-other-views,
	in-other-view, goto-other-view, other-view, goto-next-view):
	new functions to provide some level of interface to views.
	open and close should be used instead of make and destroy.
        (add-buffer, remove-buffer): now cycles through every view in
	every window, since `buffer-list' is now view-local.

Mon Aug 25 00:42:24 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* rcs.jl: New file providing a particularly simple interface
	to RCS. Do (require 'rcs) to install it.

Sun Aug 24 20:43:30 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* buffers.jl (read-file-into-buffer): new function, split off
	from open file to handle initialisation when loading a file.
	(revert-buffer): calls read-file-into-buffer

	* edit.jl (toggle-buffer-read-only): new function
	(toggle-read-only-function): new hook

	* buffers.jl (maybe-save-buffer): new function, asks whether or
	not to save a buffer if it contains unsaved modifications.

Sun Jun 25 12:01:01 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* gzip.jl (gzip-uncompress): Checks if a file exists before
	attempting to expand it -- this allows non-existent files with
	names ending in .gz or .Z to be edited properly.

Tue Mar 21 16:33:04 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* help.jl (help-prompt-keymap): Got rid of the incorrect
	`Ctrl-i' binding.

Mon Mar 20 19:29:01 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* text-mode.jl (word-count-area): New function to count the
	number of words in a region of text, bound to `Meta-=' in the
	text-mode-keymap.

Fri Jan 13 18:07:56 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* info.jl (info-parse-menu-line): Now ignores spaces between
	the name of the node and the `::' in a menu line.

Thu Jan 12 16:19:21 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* c-mode.jl (c-backslash-area): General fixes.

	* edit.jl (just-spaces): Doesn't miss the space at the
	beginning of a line anymore.

Wed Jan 11 14:42:58 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* info.jl (info-visit-file): Command to prompt for a file then
	load it into Info.

Thu Jan  5 00:03:37 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	toggle read-only-ness

Mon Jan  2 15:32:32 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* loadmenus.jl: Changed the ``Print Keymap'' item to call the
	describe-keymap command

Tue Dec 27 15:08:14 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* xc.jl (xc-indent-pos): Doesn't recognize do_... as a `do while'
	statement anymore.	

Sat Dec 24 15:10:38 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* c-mode.jl (c-backward-exp): Hopefully I've fixed the infinite
	loop which used to happen when the start of some files was reached.

Wed Dec 21 00:18:28 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* c-mode.jl (c-backward-exp): Doesn't get confused when it
	finds punctuation in the middle of an expression.

	* buffer-menu.jl: The key table now binds `LMB-Off' to `nop' to
	avoid it getting caught by the unbound-key-hook thing (and
	being really annoying).	

	* edit.jl (nop): New command, does absolutely nothing.

Tue Dec 13 20:56:11 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* c-mode.jl (c-mode-ctrl-c-keymap): Now this binds `c-backslash-area'
	to `Ctrl-c Ctrl-\' as it should have done before

Sat Nov 26 18:00:55 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* fill-mode.jl: `RET' is also made to check whether the line
	needs to be broken, as well as `SPC'.

	* xc.jl (xc-indent-pos): Fixed the regexp used to match goto
	labels, it now checks the character after the colon to be
	white space of eol.

Sun Nov 13 19:49:54 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* compile.jl (compile): unless an argument is given the command is
	*always* prompted for. Whatever the command is that is eventually
	executed is, it's stored in the `compile-command' variable.

	* buffers.jl (revert-buffer): doesn't ask if you want to revert
	to the most recent auto-save; use `recover-file' to do that!

	* xc.jl (xc-indent-pos): now indents `{' properly (I fixed a
	couple of typos -- `exp-ind' for `exp-pos')

Tue Nov  8 09:22:19 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lisp.jl (require): this can now be called interactively --
	it prompts for its first argument (the feature symbol).

Mon Nov  7 17:47:43 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* buffer-menu.jl (bm-list-buffers): now prints the mode name
	properly; i.e. chains through the list of minor mode names,
	printing each in turn.

	* fill-mode.jl (fill-mode-spc): takes account of the glyph
	position of the cursor, not the char position. Also the hack to
	auto indent indented-text-mode buffers properly works even if
	the previous line wasn't indented at all.

Thu Oct 27 23:24:42 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* asm-mode.jl: removed the `.' command. Also `RET' deletes
	any trailing TAB or SPC characters from the end of the line it
	breaks.

Wed Oct 26 17:51:47 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* gdb.jl (gdb): changed `kill-all-buffer-variables' to

	says it does

Tue Oct  4 00:33:37 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* buffers.jl (fix-local-variables): new function; scans the
	end of a newly-loaded buffer for Emacs-style local variable
	definitions. Called from `open-file'.

Mon Oct  3 17:59:44 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	created line when the major mode is indented-text-mode.

	* xc.jl: many improvements.

	* c-mode.jl (c-forward-exp, c-backward-exp): cpp lines don't
	count as an expression anymore

Sat Oct  1 16:41:42 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* modes.jl: expression functions now use word syntax if expressions
	aren't defined in the buffer

	* gzip.jl (gzip-insert-file): this hooks into `insert-file-hook'
	so inserted files can be decompressed

	* buffers.jl (insert-file): now calls the hook `insert-file-hook'

	* buffers.jl, gzip.jl: the read-file-hook now has to set the
	modtime of the buffer

Thu Sep  1 20:12:18 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* ask.jl (y-or-n-p): now resets its values in the proper buffer

	* buffer-menu.jl (bm-select-buffer): now burys the buffer-menu
	buffer

	*whole* line.

Fri Jun 24 21:46:46 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* xc.jl: experimental indentation functions for C mode; these
	give much better indentation but are a tad slower...

Thu Jun 23 20:33:41 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* All packages which define esc keymaps have had them put into
	their main keymaps (with each key Meta-qualified).

	will actually nuke a `special' buffer

Wed Jun 15 19:46:55 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* gdb.jl: interface to gdb; highlights the source of the current
	frame plus some other nice stuff

	decided to change its name since there is at least one other editor
	called jed.

	(mark-paragraph): Marks line which ends paragraph as well.
	(paragraph-start): Deleted

	* lisp-mode.jl: Got rid of `lisp-interactive-mode' entry point, the
