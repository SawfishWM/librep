2001-04-09  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: version 0.13.6, bumped library revision

2001-03-22  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: version 0.13.5, bumped library revision number

2001-03-12  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* emulate-gnu-tar, Makefile.in: new script, emulates the
	options of GNU tar that the tar file-handler uses, but using
	hopefully generic tar options and separate decompression
	programs. Used tar option combinations are `tvf -' and `xf -
	[FILE]'

2001-02-20  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: on Solaris use /usr/ccs/lib/cpp (patch from
	albert chin <china@thewrittenword.com>)

2001-01-17  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* librep.spec.in: unset LC_ALL, LINGUAS and LANG before
	building

2001-01-15  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: delete the rules.mk file each time AC_OUTPUT is
	run (since it can contain stale values, and the rule to rebuild
	it doesn't work for the top-level Makefile since it's included
	first)

	* rules.mk.sh: removed repdocfile definition, it's not used by
	anything and can confuse the librep build process

2001-01-04  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: version 0.13.4

2000-12-27  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* rules.mk.sh: removed the `-export-symbols-regex' option, it's
	not possible to just export `rep_dl_foo' symbols..

2000-12-06  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* install-aliases (dosome): patch from Peter Teichman
	<peter@helixcode.com> to avoid clobbering a variable that's
	needed in the next iteration of the loop

2000-12-03  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: version 0.13.3

2000-11-21  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* rules.mk.sh: rename repexecdir variable as repcommonexecdir
	so it doesn't conflict with Makedefs.in (shouldn't affect other
	users of this file.. I hope)

2000-11-15  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* Makedefs.in: include rules.mk and redefine $(rep_DL_LIBTOOL)
	to the uninstalled local libtool

	* rules.mk.sh: in $(rep_DL_LD) macro, specify
	-export-symbols-regex option to libtool to only retain symbols
	whose names begin with `rep_dl_'

2000-10-23  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* configure.in: version 0.13.2

2000-10-18  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	file

2000-10-11  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* install-aliases: add extra-paranoid quoting

	* configure.in: new option --enable-full-name-terminator (sets
	existing preprocessor symbol FULL_NAME_TERMINATOR)

2000-10-06  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* install-aliases: try to rename libFOO.* as well as FOO.*. On
	some systems libtool creates module libraries with a `lib'
	prefix

2000-09-29  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* librep.spec.in: override infodir in `make install' command

2000-09-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: version 0.13.1

2000-09-27  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in, config.h.in: check for strncasecmp ()

2000-09-20  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: version 0.13

2000-09-19  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* build-info: use `$LOCALDOMAIN', then `dnsdomainname', before
	falling back to `domainname'

2000-09-10  Karl M. Hegbloom  <karlheg@debian.org>

2000-09-13  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: version 0.13pre2

2000-09-08  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* man/repl.texi: new chapter `The REPL'

2000-09-05  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: adapted patch from Jacob for weird debian gmp
	header file location. Misc other changes to gmp checks

2000-09-04  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* librep.spec.in: added `--with-extra-cflags=-fstrength-reduce'
	to configure. RH force -fno-strength-reduce on i386, this leads
	to too much register pressure in the vm, spilling one of the
	fixed regs..

	* configure.in: version to 0.13pre1

2000-09-01  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* librep.spec.in: added `Requires: gdbm >= 1.8' to avoid gdbm
	brain-damage

	* librep.spec.in: install rep_config.h in -devel pkg

2000-08-31  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: create rep_config.h instead of rep.h

2000-08-29    <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* librep.spec.in: librep-devel requires exactly @version@ of
	librep package

2000-08-17  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: add -Wpointer-arith when gcc, only add
	-Wno-implicit-int on solaris

2000-08-11  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: an additional option for configure,
	--with-readline-prefix, to specify an alternate path for the
	readline include/library files (from Albert Chin-A-Young
	<china@thewrittenword.com>)

2000-08-03  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in, config.h.in: check for strtoq () as well as
	strtoll ()

2000-08-01  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* intl/intl-compat.c, intl/Makefile.in: removed my edits, intl/
	has no differences to standard gettext intl/ now

	* autogen.sh: new script

	* configure.in: removed ranlib check, remove aux-dir decl.
	Added check for <libintl.h> if gettext is in libc

	* etc/regexp.patch, etc/gc-cons: deleted

	* etc/install-sh: moved to top-level directory

	* etc/ltmain.sh, etc/ltconfig, etc/config.sub,
	etc/config.guess: deleted, use libtoolize to create these

2000-07-29  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: signal an error if no gmp and --without-gmp
	wasn't given (the error message says to use --without-gmp if
	that's want is wanted)

2000-07-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* Makedefs.in: in COMPILE_ENV changed REPEXECDIR to
	REP_DL_LOAD_PATH

	* configure.in: set GMP_LIBS to -lm if not using gmp

2000-07-24  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* install-aliases: don't use -h or -H options to grep. Solaris
	grep chokes on -H and neither are needed anyway

	* librep.spec.in: added install-aliases

2000-07-23  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* librep.spec.in: added rep_INSTALL_ALIASES

	* configure.in: version 0.13-pre, bumped libcurrent and libage

	* install-aliases: script to extract and create aliases from
	source files (C or Lisp). Installed into $(repcommonexecdir)

2000-07-20  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: version 0.12.4, bumped ${librevision}

	* Makedefs.in: set libtool mode explicitly
	* rules.mk.sh: set libtool mode explicitly; include -rpath
	option
	(from David Kaelbling <drk@sgi.com>)

2000-07-15  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: added `--without-gmp' and
	`--disable-continuations' options

	* config.h.in: added HAVE_STRTOLL, WITH_GMP, WITH_CONTINUATIONS

2000-07-13  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: redirect stderr to /dev/null when trying to run
	`aclocal --print-ac-dir'. Apparently this avoids errors if
	aclocal isn't installed (patch from Albert Chin-A-Young
	<china@thewrittenword.com>)

2000-07-12  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: version 0.12.3, bumped ${librevision}

2000-07-10  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: just use ${host_cpu} when checking for known
	stack growth directions

	* librep.spec.in: replaced `/usr/info' by `%{_infodir}'

2000-07-06  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in, lisp/Makefile.in, man/Makefile.in,
	src/Makefile.in: updated to partially build in a separate
	directory. This still doesn't work for Lisp sources (adapted
	from Martin Pottendorfer <pottendo@utanet.at>)

2000-06-29  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in: added repexecdir to installdirs target (for DOC)

2000-06-22  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: version 0.12.2, incremented librevision

	* configure.in: version 0.12.1, incremented librevision

	* configure.in, config.h.in: check sizeof long and long long
	(if available), from George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

2000-06-16  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: fixed typo when checking for shl_load in libdld

	* configure.in: version 0.12

	* configure.in: check libdld for shl_load

2000-06-09  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in: added distclean target as alias for realclean

	* configure.in: changed --with-gmp and --with-gdbm to be more
	conventional --with-gmp-prefix and --with-gdbm-prefix

	* configure.in: when extracting dependences from C files using
	GCC, use `-MM' not `-MM -MG' (from Brad Thompson <yak@mit.edu>)

2000-06-07  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: moved DOC file to ${repexecdir}
	since GDBM databases are endian-specific

	[ this is sub-optimal, since the lisp files are shared, but
	it's okay for now .. ]

2000-05-31  Karl M. Hegbloom  <karlheg@debian.org>

	* Makefile.in (TAGS): Use --regex to grab DEFSTRING, DEFSYM,
	DEFUN, and DEFUN_INT information also.
	(TAGS tags): add lowercase target name for lazy typists.
