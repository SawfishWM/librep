Sun Jun 21 01:14:21 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* unix_processes.c (run_process): the new method of detecting
	when synchronous processes have exited still didn't work. Use
	the simple option, only exit when EOF on oth streams is
	received. This puts the onus on callers to redirect streams if
	necessary

	* unix_processes.c (cmd_call_process): ensure that the
	INPUT-FILE parameter is a _local_ file name (signal an error if
	it points to a remote file)

Fri Jun 19 00:06:20 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* unix_files.c (sys_directory_file_name): don't remove the

	* unix_main.c (handle_input, cmd_sit_for, sys_accept_output):
	stop prematurely if a Lisp error is detected
	* unix_processes.c (proc_notification): stop on a Lisp error

Tue Jun 16 12:00:24 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* unix_processes.c (run_process): another attempt at fixing the
	process-exited-but-no-eof problem. Again, I think I may have it
	this time..

	* lispcmds.c (make-list, nth, nthcdr, make-vector, aset, aref,
	make-string, substring): check and signal negative arguments

	* stringmem.h, stringmem.c: add some more statistics: the
	number of _block_ allocations and frees

Sun Jun 14 11:53:36 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* files.c (cmd_copy_file): handle local->remote and
	remote->local copies correctly

Sat Jun 13 11:08:18 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* buffers.c (var_last_save_time): was expecting parameters in
	long-int format, not as a timestamp

	* unix_files.c (sys_file_modes): mask out all but the
	permission bits

	allow new functions sys_sit_for and sys_accept_input

	* unix_processes.c (cmd_accept_process_output): new function,
	accept and process output, or timeout

Mon Jun  8 14:50:17 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lisp.c (read_symbol): don't accept `0x' as a hex. number

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_mapc, cmd_mapcar): tidied up slightly

	* lispmach.c (cmd_jade_byte_code): ensure that _all_ functions
	that may end up calling Lisp code set the gc_stackbase slot

	* lisp.c (funcall): always add the current function to the
	backtrace stack. This simplifies gc protection, and provides
	better Lisp debugging information

Sat Jun  6 16:09:35 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* views.c (kill_view): new function to clean up an unused but
	non-gc'd view
	(update_views_dimensions): dont crash when the window no longer
	has room for all views, instead delete views from the top of
	the window until they all fit
	(cmd_next_view, cmd_previous_view): don't ignore inactive
	minibuffer views

	* glyphs.c (make_window_glyphs, make_message_glyphs): handle

	position in the window of a specified view
	(cmd_find_view_by_pos): include status line in view

	the status line

Thu Jun  4 14:52:49 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* find.c (mystrcmp, mystrrstrn, mystrrchrn): deleted these
	functions

	* misc.c (cmd_make_completion_string): renamed as
	`complete-string', added another arg FOLD-CASE

	* bytecodes.h, lisp.c, lispmach.c: excise all traces of the
	return function and the OP_RETURN instruction

	* buffers.c (cmd_all_buffers): new function, return a list of
	all existing buffers

Tue Jun  2 09:06:58 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_load): execute multiple matching items from
	the after-load-alist, not just the first

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_load): after using an entry in
	after-load-alist, delete it

	* lisp.h (MAKE_TIME, GET_TIME, TIMEP): new way of storing
	timestamps (DAYS . SECONDS) instead of in long-integer form
	* unix_files.c (sys_file_modtime): use new timestamp format
	* misc.c (cmd_current_time, cmd_current_time_string): use new
	timestamp format
	(cmd_fix_time): new function to normalise the two parts of a
	timestamp

Mon May 25 17:11:32 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_if, cmd_and, cmd_or): reinstated these
	special forms

	* lisp.c (throw_value): declared as volatile. This stops the
	compiler optimizing tests out of existence

Sun May 24 10:24:16 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* edit.h (WIN): new field w_DisplayedName; the string currently
	displayed as the name of this window (the current buffer's
	status id string)
	* values.c (mark_value): mark w_DisplayedName
	* redisplay.c (cmd_redisplay): if a window's current buffer's
	status id is different to its displayed name, reset it
	* x11_windows.c (sys_set_win_name): new function, set the name
	of a window

	* x11_windows.c (sys_new_window): fix size_hints structure, set

	* x11_main.c: added a `-rv' option to give proper reverse video
	(get_resources): capitalise resource names when we search under
	"Jade" (I'm sure this is incorrect, but who knows). Also added
	a reverseVideo resource
	* x11_windows.c (sys_new_window): take note of -rv option

Sat May 23 11:28:01 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* keys.c (cmd_make_keytab, cmd_make_keylist): renamed as
	make-keymap and make-sparse-keymap. make-sparse-keymap takes an
	optional argument, a sparse keymap whose bindings should be
	inherited (achieved by consing the whole thing onto the end of
	the new keymap)
	(findkey, cmd_unbind_keys): cope with finding inherited keymaps
	in the middle of lists

	* keys.h, keys.c: changed the definition of KEY (the
	representation of a single binding) to (COMMAND . (CODE .
	MODS)) instead of the old [CODE MODS COMMAND]. The cons cell
	version uses less memory

Fri May 22 10:13:26 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* keys.c (next_keymap_path): changed semantics slightly, now
	it's LISP_NULL if unset, not nil. Also changed the Lisp
	variable next-keymap-path into a function

	* buffers.c (cmd_set_buffer_name): if the buffer-status-id
	looks as though it still just names the buffer, reset it to
	use the new name

Mon May 18 09:21:33 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_delete_if, cmd_delete_if_not): added gc
	protection to these functions; how long have they been unsafe?

Sun May 17 19:50:36 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* housekeeping.c (adjust_marks_split_y): fix this again, maybe
	this time I've got it right

Sat May 16 13:51:54 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* housekeeping.c (adjust_marks_split_y): wasn't looking at the
	column position to ignore positions before the split in the
	line

	* x11_misc.c (write_clip, read_clip): deleted, not used anymore

	* unix_files.c, ../config.h.in: remove definition and use of
	HAVE_REALPATH since we provide an implementation for when libc
	doesn't

Tue May 12 16:35:42 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* x11_keys.c (translate_mods): extra arg SUBST-META controlling
	whether or not to switch the designated meta modifier for the
	more general EV_MOD_META bit. Needed by x11_find_meta.

Sun May 10 21:19:48 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* keys.c (ev_mod_meta): deleted, replaced by window-local meta
	codes
	* keys.h (EV_MOD_FAKE_META): renamed as EV_MOD_META; this is
	now used internally, instead of its translation
	* x11_keys.c (translate_mods): if the translated set of
	modifiers includes the current window's meta mask, replace this
	bit by EV_MOD_META
	(sys_find_meta): renamed x11_find_meta, now takes a x11_display
	structure as its argument. It finds the Meta modifier for a
	particular display
	* x11_main.c (x11_open_display): call x11_find_meta and set the
	display's meta_mod field
	* x11_windowsys.h (struct x11_display): added meta_mod field,
	the Meta modifier for this display

Wed May  6 12:49:17 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lisp.c (load_autoload): new parameter IS-VARIABLE for
	autoloading variables
	* lispcmds.c (cmd_defvar): set variables that are boundp, but
	whose value is an autoload definition
	* keys.c (lookup_binding): works with autoloaded variables

	* unix_client.c (main): call make-window-on-display, not
	open-window-on-display for the -x and -X options

Tue May  5 10:29:45 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_call_hook): allow the HOOK argument to be a
	symbol or a list, not just a symbol

Mon May  4 12:12:53 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* views.c (update_status_buffer): changed the layout of the
	status line again; also some kludgey attempts at catching
	buffer overruns

Sun May  3 12:20:21 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* views.c (update_status_buffer): pad the gap between the
	tx_StatusId string and the mode details with hyphens not spaces

	* misc.c (cmd_version_and_build_string): renamed as
	build-id-string, doesn't have the version-string on the front,
	but does have the HOST_TYPE (i.e. i586-pc-gnu, or whatever) on
	the end

	* unix_main.c (fatal_signal_handler): minor changes to try and
	stop the infinite looping seen with Linux at times

Wed Apr 29 09:48:37 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* debug-buffer.c, redisplay.c: change malloc/free for
	sys_alloc/sys_free

	* undo.c (cmd_undo): when clearing the modified status, set
	tx_LastSaveChanges as well as tx_ProperSaveChanges

Tue Apr 28 15:57:54 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in: added files.o to list of dependencies

	* edit.h (TX): added tx_StatusId field, a string to display in
	the status line
	(VW): removed vw_StatusBuf and STATUS_BUFSIZ, added
	vw_StatusOverride, remove VWFF_CUSTOM_STATUS flag
	* buffers.c (cmd_make_buffer): set tx_StatusId to
	"Jade: BUFFER-NAME" by default
	(buffer-status-id): interface to tx_StatusId
	* glyphs.c (make_window_glyphs): change how
	update_status_buffer is called, now it formats straight into
	the glyph buffer
	* values.c (mark_value): add tx_StatusId and vw_StatusOverride
	* views.c (make_view): don't allocate vw_StatusBuf
	(update_status_buffer): changed dramatically, now it looks more
	like Emacs; still needs to be more customisable
	(cmd_set_status_message): changed for VW structure mods

	* symbols.c (cmd_put): fix how dumped plists are modified; cons
	onto their head any new values instead

Mon Apr 27 10:51:34 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* symbols.c (kill-all-local-variables): obey the
	`permanent-local' property of symbols

	* views.c (make_view): when copying the vw_BufferList, actually
	make a _copy_ using copy-sequence not just copy the pointer

Sun Apr 26 19:23:28 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* views.c (make_view): minor changes to how we set up the view
	* windows.c (cmd_make_window, cmd_destroy_window): assume
	responsibilities of open-window and close-window.
	destroy-window renamed as delete-window, and split into two
	functions, delete_window, and cmd_delete_window. The Lisp
	variant calls save-and-quit if window_count==1
	(sym_make_window_hook): no longer passed an argument
	(sym_destroy_window_hook): renamed delete-window-hook
	(cmd_window_list): new function
	(sym_window_closed_hook): deleted
	* x11_windows.c (cmd_make_window_on_display): made interactive
	* x11_main.c (handle_event): call delete-window, not
	window-closed-hook

	* redisplay.c, glyphs.c: another attempt to fix a display bug

	* edit.h (TXFF_SPECIAL): deleted this flag

	* buffers.c (destroy-buffer): deleted this function, let
	buffers be garbage collected as other objects are
	(buffer-modified-p): don't look at the TXFF_SPECIAL flag
	(set-buffer-special, buffer-special-p): deleted

	* views.c (update_status_buffer): ignore TXFF_SPECIAL, give
	read-only flag higher priority than modified flag

Fri Apr 24 11:35:03 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* unix_processes.c (cmd_active_processes): new function, return
	a list of all active processes
	(proc_notification): when calling functions, now pass the
	process as the sole argument

	* unix_processes.c (mark_active_processes): function to mark
	any processes that are currently active
	* values.c (cmd_garbage_collect): call mark_active_processes
	when HAVE_SUBPROCESSES is defined. This stops executing
	processes with no references from disappearing

Wed Apr 22 17:21:07 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* views.c (make_view): try to initialise the vw_BufferList
	(cmd_make_view): renamed split-view, deleted the BUFFER
	parameter, made interactive. This replaces open-view
	(cmd_destroy_view): renamed delete-view, made interactive. This
	replaces close-view

Tue Apr 21 16:45:05 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* unix_processes.c (get_pty): minor change to order in which
	pty masters are searched

	* misc.c (cmd_sleep_for): new function, pauses for a specified
	time length
	* unix_main.c (sys_sleep_for): support for sleep-for

	* buffers.c, streams.c (mark_prin, file_prin): wasn't calling
	stream_puts correctly

Sat Apr 18 00:16:46 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* find.c (buffer_reverse_strpbrk): when matching a newline, the
	position returned was one column too far to the left

	* unix_processes.c (run_process): when running synchronously,
	if the child exits before EOFs are received, allow a few more
	polls of input before exiting. Hopefully this should be enough
	to ensure that no final output from the process is missed. Of
	course, this means that putting a shell command into the
	background will take a few seconds to return

	* lispcmds.c (sym_jade_dir, sym_lisp_lib_dir,
	sym_site_lisp_dir): new pre-defined symbols
	(lispcmds_init): when defined, the environment variables
	JADEDIR, JADELISPLIB, JADESITELISP and JADEDOCFILE are used to
	initialise the locations of the corresponding files and
	directories
	* unix_defs.h (LISP_LIB_DIR, SITE_LISP_DIR, DOC_FILE): renamed
	each macro to ..._SUFFIX, removing the constant JADE_DIR prefix

Fri Apr 17 14:20:01 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lisp.c, lispmach.c, redisplay.c, symbols.c: add preprocessor
	magic from autoconf manual to handle alloca declaration
	* unix_main.c (sys_event_loop): when C_ALLOCA is defined call
	alloca(0) to garbage collect

	* files.c (cmd_canonical_file_name): call
	sys_canonical_file_name for unhandled files
	* unix_files.c (sys_canonical_file_name): new function, uses
	realpath to expand links in a file name
	(sys_expand_file_name): fix bug in expanding "foo/../bar"
	* unix_defs.h: prototype for realpath when HAVE_REALPATH isn't
	defined

	* Makefile.in: handle LIBOBJS and ALLOCA correctly, some
	cosmetic changes

Tue Apr  7 11:20:28 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* unix_processes.c (run_process): when running synchronously,
	look for the child exiting, as well as EOF on its output
	streams. If it does exit, stop and close all streams. This is
	to allow shell commands to be put into the background mainly
	(though they'll get a SIGPIPE if they do any output)

Mon Apr  6 09:26:30 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* glyphs.c (make_window_glyphs): reinitialise glyph_row each
	view; I think this may fix an intermittent bug in which the
	line after the end of the glyph buffer is accessed

Sat Apr  4 17:57:50 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* unix_files.c (sys_file_symlink_p): fixed to use lstat() again
	instead of stat_file(), and therefore stat()
	(sys_file_modes_as_string): S and T bits had their case the
	wrong way around, now they're lowercase if the corresponding
	execute bit is also set, as in "ls -l"

Fri Apr  3 10:47:31 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* edit.h (glyph_buf): includes arrays of pointers to each line
	instead of the GLYPH_BUF_CODES and GLYPH_BUF_ATTRS macros
	* glyphs.c, redisplay.c: modifications for new glyph_buf
	structure
	* redisplay.c (hash_glyph_row): don't rotate, the hash values
	it generated weren't very well distributed. Go back to K=33

	* unix_server.c: if DEBUG_SERVER is defined generate trace of
	all server traffic into a debug buffer
	(server_accept_connection): set the fd returned from accept()
	to be _blocking_. I didn't realise that accepted connections
	inherit the characteristics of listening socket. This was the
	cause of the intermittent bug (a read returning EAGAIN when I
	didn't expect it)

	* unix_main.c (unix_set_fd_blocking): new function, opposite of
	unix_set_fd_nonblocking

	* jade.h: include <stdarg.h>

	* debug-buffer.c (db_printf, db_vprintf): split the old
	db_printf into these two functions

	* undo.c (undo_record_unmodified): function to call when a
	buffer is set as being unmodified; it deletes any previous
	"unmodified" mark in the undo list
	* buffers.c (cmd_set_buffer_modified): when STATUS is nil, call
	undo_record_unmodified

	* redisplay.c (hash_glyph_row): rotate the hash value instead
	of just shifting

Wed Apr  1 00:54:36 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* files.c: new file, groups together all functions dealing with
	files; also implements Emacs-like magic-file-names using the
	`file-handler-alist' variable
	* unix_files.c: new file, functions to implement the built-in
	file handler for files in the local filing system
	* lisp.h: changed Lisp_File structure slightly

	* buffers.c, edit.c, lispcmds.c, streams.c, unix_main.c,
	unix_processes.c, unix_server.c, values.c, x11_main.c:
	modifications to handle new file primitives. Mainly to deal
	with canonical names (to compare to files), and most
	importantly, ensuring that everything is gc-protected whilst
	calling any function in files.c that could invoke some Lisp
	code

	* edit.h (TX): added tx_CanonicalFileName field

	* find.c (push_regexp_data, pop_regexp_data): functions for
	preserving the regexp match data

	* jade.h: always include regexp.h

	* keys.c (eval_input_event): fix bug when inserting repeated
	string

	* lisp.c (cmd_add_doc_string, cmd_get_doc_string): deleted
	(call_lisp3, call_lisp4): new functions
	(funcall): guarantee that arguments will be gc-protected

	* lispcmds.c (sym_documentation_file): new variable
	(cmd_substring): moved here from misc.c

	* main.c: if an error occurs in startup, print it to stderr

	* misc.c: lots of reorganisation, including:
	(sym_operating_system, sym_window_system): replace
	x11-p, unix-p and amiga-p functions
	(system): deleted
	(getenv): deleted, now in environ.jl

	* unix_main.c (unix_set_fd_nonblocking, unix_set_fd_cloexec):
	new functions
	(sigio_handler): unused support for async input

	* unix_processes.c: use process-environment variable to give
	environ of each subprocess

Fri Mar 20 12:24:50 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* x11_windowsys.h (CLEAR_GLYPHS, FILL_GLYPHS): new macros, for
	clearing and filling a horizontal sequence of glyphs in a window

	* redisplay.c (redisplay_do_draw): while scanning a line for
	attribute changes, also check if the chunk to be drawn consists
	only of spaces. If so use the CLEAR_GLYPHS or FILL_GLYPHS
	macros to draw it

Thu Mar 19 14:54:39 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* unix_client.c: two new options "-" and "--", for different
	methods of evaluating forms read from stdin. "-" is intended
	for interactive use, "--" for batch use

	* symbols.c (cmd_makunbound, cmd_fmakunbound): don't set slots
	to LISP_NULL, but to void_value

Tue Mar 17 11:11:29 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* glyphs.c (recenter_cursor): fixed a couple of bugs
	(line_glyph_length): added special case for direct-mapped
	cache; currently this is what's being used

Mon Mar 16 10:47:21 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lispmach.c, bytecodes.h (OP_FILTER, OP_MACROP, OP_BYTECODEP):
	new opcodes

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_filter): new function, similar to the Miranda
	function of the same name, construct a new list containing
	elements of an input list that satisfy a predicate

	* x11_keys.c (translate_event): was always using the display at
	the head of the x11_display_list to convert keycodes to
	keysyms; now use the display that the event came from

Sat Mar 14 14:58:34 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* streams.c (cmd_format, sym_format_hooks_alist): big overhaul
	of the format function. Now flags work with most conversions,
	and user-defined conversions are possible via the
	format-hooks-alist variable

	* unix_main.c (cmd_file_symlink_p): was using stat() instead of
	lstat() to get the file's attributes

Fri Mar 13 15:06:28 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	`mbu_FreeCount', contains the number of available objects in
	the buffer

	* lisp.h: Changed the VALUE format again. Now its:

	"Bit definitions for VALUE pointers. The lowest bit is always
	zero except during GC. If bit one is set the object is a 30-bit
	signed integer, with the data bits stored in the pointer as
	bits 2->31.

	If bit one is clear the VALUE is a pointer to a "cell", all
	objects apart from integers are represented by various types of
	cells. Every cell has a VALUE as its first element, the lowest
	bits of this VALUE define the actual type of the cell.

	If bit zero is unset, the cell is a cons, a pair of two
	values the car and the cdr (the GC mark bit of the cons is bit
	zero of the cdr).

	If bit zero is set the cell more type information is stored
	in bits 1->6, with bit 7 the mark bit."

	* lispmach.c, bytecodes.h: totally rethought how exceptions
	(i.e. unwind-protect, catch/throw and condition-case) are
	handled. Before the handler forms were compiled into separate
	byte-code forms. Now we handle them inline to the original
	piece of code. The idea is that the new instruction OP_BINDERR
	registers an exception handler (an offset into the byte-code
	string), along with the current stack pointer, by adding to the
	binding stack. When an exception occurs the bind stack is
	unbound, when a (PC . SP) item is found, the stack pointer is
	set to SP, throw_value is pushed onto it, and PC is jumped to.
	The EJMP instruction can be used to give control back to the C
	error handler.

	(OP_CATCH_KLUDGE, OP_UNWIND_PRO, OP_UN_UNWIND_PRO,
	OP_ERROR_PRO) all been deleted.

	(OP_CATCH): new opcode. This takes two arguments, TAG and
	THROW-VALUE. THROW-VALUE is the saved copy of throw_value, if
	(car THROW-VALUE) == TAG we match, and we leave two values on
	the stack, nil on top (to pacify EJMP), (cdr THROW-VALUE) below
	that.

	(OP_BINDERR): Pop our single argument and cons it onto the
	bind- stack in a pair with the current stack-pointer. This
	installs an address in the code string as an error handler.

	(OP_ERRORPRO): This should be called with three values on the
	stack. 1. conditions of the error handler 2. throw_value of the
	exception 3. symbol to bind the error data to (or nil). It pops
	(1) and tests it against the error in (2). If they match it
	sets (2) to nil, and binds the error data to the symbol in (3).

	(OP_EJMP): Pop the stack; if it's nil jmp pc[0,1], otherwise
	set throw_value=ARG and goto the C error handler.

	* lisp.c (cmd_error_protect): renamed this as condition-case
	and inserted a new first parameter VAR, the symbol to bind the
	error data to. This is the same as Emacs function, it's
	necessary for the new VM error handling
	(compare_error): new function to compare the conditions a
	handler says it will take, against the error that was
	signalled

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_unwind_protect): only reinstall the old throw
	if it's actually an error and there was no error in the cleanup
	forms. This way the newest error takes precedence

Mon Jan 12 22:15:55 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* find.c (buffer-compare-string): function to compare a string
	with a position in a buffer

	* lisp.c (sym_debug_macros, eval): when debug-macros is nil the
	debugger is never entered to expand a macro definition

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_max, cmd_min): new functions
	* bytecodes.h, lispmach.c (OP_MAX, OP_MIN): new instructions

Sun Jan 11 19:16:09 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_load, sym_eval_after_load): a method of having
	a form be evaluated after a specified Lisp-library is loaded.

Tue Jan  6 13:06:06 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* edit.c (pad_cursor): reinstall the original cursor position
	after calling pad_pos(), since spaces may have been inserted
	before it, pushing it further down the line.

	* unix_processes.c (check_for_zombies): re-ordered a lot of this
	function. Also fixed the bug where errno was being looked at
	even if the return from waitpid() was zero.

Sat Jan  3 20:57:03 1998  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* refresh.c (refresh_block): move the initialisation of tstart
	and tend to before they're passed as arguments to sub_regions()

Sun Dec 21 02:48:28 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lisp.h (VCONS): don't mask out the VALUE_CONS_MARK_BIT, if
	this needs to be done, it's done explicitly

	* lisp.h (LISP_MAX_INT, LISP_MIN_INT): macros defining the
	limits of what can be stored in integer values

	* lisp.c (read_symbol): rewrote the code to parse integers, it
	does all calculation inline, removing the need to call
	strtol() at the end, plus negative hexadecimal numbers work
	properly now.

Sat Dec 20 00:01:55 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* misc.c, build-info, Makefile.in: the shell script build-info
	produces a header file build.h, defining some of the
	circumstances of the build process. misc.c includes this
	header file and makes the information available through the
	`version-and-build-string' function.

	* lisp.h (Lisp_Data_Type): Added a new `sweep' field, a
	function to call in the sweep phase of GC

	* values.c (data_types): filled in the new `sweep' field
	(cmd_garbage_collect): call each `sweep' function in turn
	instead of doing this by name

	* unix_processes.c (proc_init): now installs type information
	about V_Process objects in data_types[] itself.
	also removed the __waitpid__ debugging since the bug never
	occurred, maybe it will now...

	* lisp.h: Positions are now (ROW . COL), we keep the `Pos'
	structures for internal use, to avoid the masking and shifting
	required to access Lisp cons and integers. Having said that,
	they're not used that widely, just a few functions.

	* editcommands.c (pos-col, pos-line): removed these, they're
	defined in lisp.jl as macros (cdr and car respectively)

	* bytecodes.h, lispmach.c (OP_POS, OP_POSP): two new opcodes,
	the pos and posp functions. Note that pos isn't the same as
	cons since it replaces nil arguments with the current row or
	column of the cursor (also, of course, the arguments are the
	opposite order to in the cons function.)

	* lisp.h: Totally changed the way that VALUEs (Lisp objects)
	are defined; instead of wasting memory storing type
	information in cons cells and storing integers as allocated
	objects, we now do some bit-twiddling to store a subset of the
	type information in the two or three lowest bits of the VALUE.

	This means that cons cells only take 2 words (8 bytes) instead
	of 3, and integers can be stored in the VALUE itself (but now
	we only have 29-bit signed integers, not 32). Also we have to
	enforce strict alignment rules: cons cells to at least eight
	bytes, _everything_ else to at least four bytes.

	It's basically trading memory use in the data section for
	some code bloat (the extra instructions to do the bit
	twiddling). It's not too bad though, all objects but cons
	cells and numbers can be accessed from a VALUE as-is, once
	their type has been established (which does take a few more
	instructions).

	I've also taken this opportunity to clean up some of the other
	Lisp object handling code. Also, the plan is to remove
	position objects completely and store them as a cons cell
	containing two integers.

	To overcome the loss of the three bits in integers, I've
	defined a new pseudo-type called LONG_INT, which is a cons
	cell containing the low 24 bits in its car, and the high bits
	in the cdr. This allows large values like time stamps to be
	stored without dropping bits.

	* configs/config.h.*: added some more configuration macros, all
	to do with alignment,
	(MALLOC_ALIGNMENT): this has to be defined to the minimum
	alignment of malloc() allocations. It's checked in an assert
	in unix_memory.c currently
	(PTR_SIZED_INT): by default `long int', this must be an
	implicitly signed integer of the same size as a standard
	pointer (i.e. sizeof(PTR_SIZED_INT) == sizeof(void *), this is
	also checked, in main.c)
	(ALIGN_4, ALIGN_8): these aren't actually mentioned in the
	config files, but they align definitions to four and eight
	bytes respectively. For GNU CC they'll be defined in jade.h
	when not already existing

	* lisp.c (handle_var_long_int): similar to handle_var_int, but
	for 32 bit integers stored in cons cells
	* buffers.c (var_last_save_time): defined as a LONG_INT now
	* misc.c (cmd_current_time): returns a LONG_INT now
	(cmd_time_later_p): new function for comparing time stamps

	* edit.h (TX): Changed some long fields to ints, to signal
	that they can be stored in less than 24 bits

	* jade.h (ALIGN_4, ALIGN_8): definitions for GNU CC
	(CONCAT, OFFSETOF): new macros

	* stringmem.c, stringmem.h: formalised old alignment
	assumptions, all allocated blocks will be aligned to at least
	four bytes.
	(STRMEM_ALIGNMENT): defined to the minimum alignment of blocks
	allocated by sm_alloc()

Tue Dec 16 12:05:14 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_or, cmd_and): deleted, these are now macros
	in lisp.jl

Mon Dec 15 10:52:24 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* edit.c: When allocating line buffers, use the knowledge that
	stringmem.c allocates memory in multiples of eight bytes to
	improve our allocation strategy. Lines are also allocated in
	multiples of eight bytes, and insertions/deletions that don't
	cause a multiple-of-eight boundary to be crossed are handled
	by a simple memory copy.
	(LINE_BUF_SIZE, ALLOC_LINE_BUF, FREE_LINE_BUF): macros to
	implement the above strategy
	(alloc_line_buf): function version of ALLOC_LINE_BUF
	(delete_section): when joining two lines, optimise the case
	where either of the lines is empty
	* io.c (read_tx): all line allocations use alloc_line_buf()
	now.

	* bytecodes.h (OP_JPN, OP_JPT): new opcodes, jump-and-pop-if-t
	and jump-and-pop-if-nil
	* lispmach.c (jade-byte-code): implemented JPN and JPT

Sun Dec 14 14:10:47 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* editrect.c: removed, now implemented in Lisp in rectangle.jl
	* Makefile.in: removed editrect.c from COMMON_SRCS
	* main.c (inner_main): removed call to editrect_init()

	* glyphs.c (char-to-glyph-pos, glyph-to-char-pos): now check
	the validity of the POS argument

	* find.c (string-match): new optional arg START, defining
	where in the string to start searching

	* Radically changed the way in which position objects are
	handled. Removed the old POS/LPos distinction; now we only
	have positions as Lisp objects, two new macros VCOL(p) and
	VROW(p) to access the two components of a position.

	But perhaps the most important change is that positions in
	Lisp objects are _immutable_, that is, once they've been
	created their contents can not be modified. Although this may
	appear to involve many more objects being allocated, this
	isn't necessarily the case since pointers to position objects
	may be passed around much more freely, for example, when
	creating undo information.

	There is a distinction made between accessing positions
	through VALUEs, and through `Pos *' pointers---the latter are
	generally stored on the stack and hence writable.

	The immutability of positions means that the functions
	next-char, et al. which _modify_ position objects are no
	longer valid. A list of function changes follows:

	* editcommands.c (set-pos-col, set-pos-row, split-line):
	removed, split-line implemented in edit.jl

	* movement.c (next-char, prev-char): renamed as forward-char
	(next-line, prev-line): renamed as forward-line
	(next-tab, prev-tab): renamed as forward-tab
	In all of these backward-X is provided by lisp/edit.jl. These
	functions are similar to the old ones, but always return a new
	position.
	(screen-top-line, screen-bottom-line,
	screen-first-column, screen-last-column): removed, they were
	never used
	(left-char, right-char): removed, sort of implemented as
	macros in edit.jl
	(goto-char): renamed as `goto'
	(buffer-end, line-end): renamed as `end-of-X'
	(buffer-start, line-start): renamed a `start-of-X'
	(goto-buffer-start, goto-buffer-end, goto-line-start,
	goto-buffer-end, goto-next-line, goto-prev-line,
	goto-left-char, goto-right-char, goto-prev-tab, goto-next-tab,
	goto-next-char, goto-prev-char): removed, most of the new
	functions can be called interactively instead
	(match-brackets): renamed as `find-matching-bracket'

	* find.c: lots of name changes. Also added a 1-deep cache of
	compiled regexps, preliminary results indicate a 10% hit ratio
	(find-next-regexp, find-prev-regexp): renamed as
	`re-search-forward' and `re-search-backward'
	(find-next-string, find-prev-string): renamed as
	`search-forward' and `search-backward'
	(find-next-char, find-prev-char): renamed as
	`char-search-forward' and `char-search-backward'
	(regexp-quote): renamed as `quote-regexp'
	(regexp-match): renamed as `string-match'
	(replace-string, replace-regexp, regexp-expand,
	regexp-expand-line, regexp-match-line): removed,
	replace-string implemented in lisp/replace.jl
	(expand-last-match): expands a template using the
	subexpression data of the most recent regexp match

	* I have a sed script that will perform a lot of these name
	changes,

s/(buffer-start/(start-of-buffer/
s/(buffer-end/(end-of-buffer/
s/(line-start/(start-of-line/
s/(line-end/(end-of-line/
s/(goto-char/(goto/
s/(match-brackets/(find-matching-bracket/
s/(next-char/(forward-char/
s/(next-line/(forward-line/
s/(next-tab/(forward-tab/
s/(goto-buffer-start)/(goto (start-of-buffer))/
s/(goto-buffer-end)/(goto (end-of-buffer))/
s/(goto-line-start)/(goto (start-of-line))/
s/(goto-line-end)/(goto (end-of-line))/
s/(find-next-regexp/(re-search-forward/
s/(find-prev-regexp/(re-search-backward/
s/(find-next-string/(search-forward/
s/(find-prev-string/(search-backward/
s/(find-next-char/(char-search-forward/
s/(find-prev-char/(char-search-backward/
s/(regexp-quote/(quote-regexp/
s/(regexp-match/(string-match/

	It still leaves a lot to be done by hand though, all prev-char,
	prev-line and prev-tab calls should be changed to forward-X
	with negative arguments (faster than calling backward-X); also
	the result of the function must be used now.

	* unix_processes.c: once again I've simplified the process
	termination code; now the only thing done in the SIGCHLD
	handler is to set a flag that is checked by a function called
	after every event/timeout by x11_eventloop.c, I've also added
	some debugging trace info. to try and narrow down the
	intermittent bug that causes synchronous processes to hang on
	exit (if it still exists)

	* debug-buffer.c: new file; provides circular output buffers
	and a `db_printf' function to output to them, on a crash or by
	called `db_spew' their contents is output

	* unix_misc.c: all standard signal handling is here now,
	including the SIGINT handler that used to be in x11_display.c

	All error signals (FPE, ILL, SEGV, BUS, QUIT, ABRT) are
	trapped and cause all debug buffers, and the lisp backtrace to
	be output before termination.

	SIGINT works as before, by stuffing int_cell into throw_value

	All other termination signals (TERM, HUP) cause term_cell to
	be stuffed into throw_value, this winds back to the top-level
	event loop, which auto-saves all modified files before quitting

	* x11_eventloop.c: now calls proc_periodically() instead of
	proc_notification(), also handles finding sym_term_interrupt
	in the car of the throw_value (as described in the previous
	paragraph).

	* x11_windows.c (screen-width, screen-height, window-left-edge,
	window-top-edge, window-width, window-height,
	window-bar-height): removed, they weren't used by anything

	* buffers.c (auto-save-buffers): new boolean argument,
	`force_save', when true the time factor when looking for files
	to auto save is ignored.
	(get_tx_cursor_ptr): similar to `get_tx_cursor' but returns a
	ptr-to-a-ptr

	* edit.c: cleaned up the myriad of insignificant functions

	* misc.c (strtoc, ctostr): removed these ugly functions
	(version-string): new function returning a string describing
	the current editor version

	* streams.c (stderr-file): does for stderr what stdout-file
	does for stdout

	* views.c (view-origin): returns the position of the top-left
	character in the view

	* configs/config.h.* (HAVE_PSIGNAL, HAVE_STRSIGNAL): two new
	configuration macros

	* regexp/regexp.h, regexp/regjade.c, regexp/regsub.c: changes
	for new position objects, also some changes to calling format

Mon Dec  8 11:32:15 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* undo.c (undo_record_insertion, undo_record_deletion,
	undo_record_modification, undo_push_deletion): ensure that
	null commands are ignored (i.e. when START == END)

	* editcommands.c (cmd_set_indent_pos): in the `diff > 0'
	section, the undo_record_modification() function was being
	called _after_ the modification had been performed, not before
	as it should be

	* unix_processes.c: Simplified the async. process clean up; the
	PR_EXITED value has been scrapped. Now we assume that once we
	receive SIGCHLD from a process there won't be any more output
	coming from it. This seems to work ok but I think there may be
	race-conditions involved (between the main select() and the
	clean up code). Needs serious investigation.

	* x11_eventloop.c: Removed call to proc_on_idle()

Wed Nov 26 13:13:52 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* jade.h: reorganised a bit
	(MAX,MIN,POS): macros for maximum, minimum, and positive part,
	respectively
	(ROUND_UP_INT, ROUND_DOWN_INT): rounding macros

	* housekeeping.c (resync_y): rewritten; fixed the bug in which
	the cursor was sometimes being left outside the visible
	region. Also avoids unnecessary space being left at the bottom
	of the display in certain circumstances

Mon Nov 24 11:25:06 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_last): now returns the last element as it
	should, not the last cons cell

Sun Nov 23 16:09:44 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lisp.c (signal_missing_arg): put the argument number into a
	list.

	* lispcmds.c (APPLY_COMPARISON): don't check for numerical
	args, comparison works on all objects. Signal an error if less
	than two arguments are given

	* lispmach.c (unbind_one_level): when reinstalling a view,
	check that its parent window is still valid

	* views.c (cmd_with_view): don't save the old window, it's
	stored in the view structure

	* windows.c (cmd_with_window): reinstall the current view in
	the old window, as well as the window itself

Fri Nov 21 12:23:16 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lispcmds.c: generally improved error reporting, especially
	of missing arguments (a lot of functions just returned NULL,
	no errors or anything..) Also functions which take lists as
	arguments don't silently ignore anything that's not a cons
	cell, an error is signalled if it's not LISTP (cons or nil)
	(cmd_plus): no arguments gives a result of zero.
	(cmd_product): no arguments gives a result of one.
	(cmd_remainder): restricted to two arguments now, any more are
	pretty meaningless
	(cmd_mod): new function implementing the modulo operation,
	similar to cmd_remainder but works properly for negative
	arguments.
	(cmd_gtthan, cmd_gethan, cmd_ltthan, cmd_lethan): can now take
	more than two arguments

	* lisp.c (signal_missing_arg): new function for convenience

	* lisp.h (LISTP): new macro, disjunction of NILP and CONSP

	* bytecodes.h, lispmach.c (OP_MOD): renamed as OP_REM to allow
	a new instruction OP_MOD that does the proper modulo operation

	* lispmach.c (cmd_validate_byte_code): new function to check
	if a given byte code instruction set version may be executed
	in the current version of the editor
	* bytecodes.h (BYTECODE_MAJOR_VERSION, BYTECODE_MINOR_VERSION):
	macros defining the current byte code version

Mon Nov 17 19:02:44 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* undo.c (undo_end_of_command): this new function replaces
	both undo_distinct() and undo_new_group(). Instead of trying
	to be clever when adding group separators, simply add one
	after _every_ event is processed. Also, separators are added to
	_every_ buffer whose last undo item is not already a separator.
	(cmd_undo): new optional arg controlling the number of
	commands that are undone; when called interactively this is
	taken from the prefix arg.

	* commands.c (cmd_call_command): removed calls to
	undo_distinct().
	* x11_eventloop.c, amiga_eventloop.c: removed all calls to
	undo_distinct(), replaced by two strategically placed calls to
	undo_end_of_command().
	* keys.c (usekey): removed calls to undo_distinct(). To ensure
	that successive self-bound key insertions are merged in the
	undo list, any leading group-separator after a previous
	insertion command is removed before inserting the text (and
	then replaced at the head of the undo list afterwards).

	* views.c (cmd_translate_pos_to_view): adds vw_StartCol into
	the column of the result

Sun Nov 16 01:22:06 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* movement.c (cmd_raw_mouse_pos): new function giving the
	glyph position of the mouse relative to the origin of the
	current window

	* views.c (cmd_find_view_by_pos): new function to find the
	view in a window specified by a window-relative position
	(cmd_translate_pos_to_view): new function to make a
	buffer-relative glyph position from a window-relative glyph
	position and a view

	* x11_eventloop.c, x11_windows.c (handle_event,
	sys_get_mouse_pos): try not to query the server for the
	pointer position---when possible grab it from the last event.

	* glyphs.c (char_col): try to handle columns past the end of
	a line without crashing

Fri Nov 14 12:44:01 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* io.c (read_tx): Now uses a predictive method of allocating the
	array of line headers whilst loading files. The average number of
	chars-per-line in the last file loaded is used to predict the
	number of lines in the current file. If this prediction is wrong
	the chars-per-line of the loaded portion of the new file is used
	to refine the predicted number of lines.

	* unix_misc.c, amiga_misc.c (sys_file_length): new function to
	return the size, in bytes, of a named file, or -1 if the size
	is unknown. Currently the Amiga implementation is totally
	untested.

	* edit.c (clear_line_list, kill_line_list, resize_line_list): the
 	tx_Line array of line headers now includes "slack", i.e. unused
 	entries at the end of the array. Currently a maximum of 32 extra
	entries, allocated as +/- 16. This makes line insertion/deletion
	faster, as well as possibly reducing memory fragmentation.
	* edit.h (TX): added tx_TotalLines field to allow unused entries
	at the end of the tx_Lines array

Fri Nov  7 09:52:30 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* render.c (draw_bit, draw_line, draw_block_line, draw_line,
	draw_line_part, draw_line_glyph_length): miscellaneous fixes,
	mostly to help fix block rendering
	
	* edit.h (TX): new variables tx_LastLogicalStart and
	tx_LastLogicalEnd; the restriction at the last refresh.
	* refresh.c: now uses tx_LastLogical{Start,End} to see if the
	restriction has changed, if so just redraw everything
	* buffers.c (cmd_restrict_buffer): don't set TXFF_REFRESH_ALL
	anymore, it's covered by the variables described above
	* housekeeping.c: the position updating functions also update
	tx_LastLogical{Start,End}

Mon Nov  3 01:27:49 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* refresh.c (refresh_block, refresh_view,
	sub_intersect_regions, sub_regions): _much_ better handling of
	block refresh--now only the stuff that needs to be redrawn
	actually is! The sub_* functions implement two set/logical
	operations on pairs of regions

	* render.c (redraw_region): better clipping of region

	* views.c (cmd_set_rect_blocks): sets the VWFF_FORCE_REFRESH
	flag; this should really be done properly

	* edit.c (set_block_refresh): just sets VWFF_REFRESH_BLOCK

	* edit.h (VW): new fields vw_LastBlockS, vw_LastBlockE,
	vw_LastBlockStatus.

	* housekeeping.c: updates the two new fields in the VW
	structure.

Thu Oct 30 13:16:45 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* unix_processes.c (run_process): some fixes made to the
	synchronous parent code; shouldn't hang anymore (?) and now does
	time outs to look for user interruptions

Tue Oct 28 17:07:53 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* unix_processes.c: Hopefully fixed the long-running "process
	exited but no eof" debacle; everything should work now (famous
	last words). Also separates the stdout and stderr streams when
	using pipes; the process-error-stream and set-process-error-stream
	functions control where the output actually goes. By default it's
	set to the same value as the output-stream
	(run_process): when using a pty initialise some of the more basic
	control codes to sensible values

	* x11_eventloop.c (event_loop): now calls proc_notification()
	_after_ going through the input fd's and handling the idle
	stuff

Tue Oct  7 13:12:03 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* movement.c (cmd_center_display): renamed from
	centre-display. Now takes a second optional argument
	controlling where in the display to put the line under the
	cursor. Taken from the prefix-arg when interactive.

Thu Oct  2 18:32:17 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* unix_processes.c (proc_on_idle): new function called when the
	editor is idle; it acts as a safety net for processes that have
	exited but haven't given an EOF over the connection. Any such
	processes are marked as truly dead
	* x11_eventloop.c (event_loop): calls proc_on_idle()

Wed Oct  1 21:00:17 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* render.c (redraw_lines_clr): check arguments against
	tx_Logical{Start,End} more rigorously.

Sun Sep 28 22:03:43 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* housekeeping.c (adjust_marks_join_y): fixed a really bad bug
	that must have existed for _years_. If the position being updated
	was past the two lines being joined it wasn't adjusted

Sat Sep 27 11:34:13 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* lisp.c (sym_print_escape_newlines, sym_print_level,
	sym_print_length): variables controlling how lists and strings
	are printed

	* housekeeping.c (adjust_marks_add_y, adjust_marks_sub_y,
	adjust_marks_split_y, adjust_marks_join_y): these now update
	vw_LastDisplayOrigin iff they update vw_DisplayOrigin. This
	stops the refresh code scrolling erroneously

	* x11_render.c (redraw_exposed_area): recognises when expose
	events hit status lines correctly now

Thu Sep 25 09:48:57 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* unix_misc.c (same_files): tries to compare files that don't
 	actually exist

	* amiga_misc.c (cmd_file_name_absolute_p): new function

	* unix_defs.h, amiga_defs.h: Define SITE_LISP_DIR

	* lispcmds.c (sym_load_path): added site-lisp directory

	* revision.h: Now protected by #ifndef stuff

	* Makefile.in: Added revision.h to HDRS

	* jade.h: Include revision.h

Wed Sep 24 11:11:49 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* misc.c (cmd_file_name_equal):	new function, called file-name=,
	that tests whether two filenames actually refer to the same
	file.

	* x11_eventloop.c (x11_last_event_time): variable containing the
	timestamp from the last X11 event (that has a timestamp).

	* x11_misc.c: Now each selection info has the timestamp of when
	the selection was created. x11_lose_selection() ignores events
	with times less than or equal to this time

	* x11_misc.c (cmd_x11_own_selection_p): returns t when Jade has
 	the selection
	(x11_window_lose_selections): lose anything owned by a particular
	window
	(x11_set_selection): can now set a string as the current selection

	* x11_windows.c (sys_kill_window): calls
	x11_window_lose_selections()

Tue Sep 23 10:55:03 1997  John Harper  (john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk)

	* views.c (update_status_buffer): all line numbers/counts now
	take note of the current restriction. Also the buffer position
	is displayed in "all/top/bottom/percentage" style

	* refresh.c (refresh_view): call resync_xy() before redrawing
	the status line, not after.

	* unix_server.c, amiga_server.c: (server-reply): compare files
	with same_file() not just comparing their names (which doesn't
	always work)

Mon Sep 22 17:53:50 1997  John Harper  (john@gem.dcs.warwick.ac.uk)

	* editcommands.c (delete-area): given it an interactive spec 
	(the current block)

	* buffers.c (restrict_buffer): made the interactive spec clear
	the block

	* keys.c, keys.h: new handling of meta modifier. Now defined as a
 	variable in keys.c. This allows meta to change from system to
 	system.

	* x11_keys.c, amiga_keys.c (sys_find_meta): new function
	to return the meta modifier mask for the current system. Also some
	work to decode and encode meta modifiers

Mon Sep 22 00:03:08 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* lispmach.c: (slightly) better error reporting for when
	arguments aren't of the required type for inlined functions

	* views.c, windows.c, buffers.c (cmd_with_view,
	cmd_with_window, cmd_with_buffer): these now signal an error
	if the first argument isn't of the required type

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_unwind_protect): don't lose errors occuring
	in the cleanup-forms anymore

Sun Sep 21 14:42:19 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* views.c (cmd_destroy_view): don't let minibuffer views be
	killed anymore

Sat Sep 20 00:20:29 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* unix_processes.c (cmd_call_process_area): new function to
	call a process with a portion of the current buffer as its
	input.

	* misc.c (cmd_tmp_file_name): now uses its own buffer

	* io.c (cmd_write_buffer_area): fixed bug which could cause an
	attempt to write -1 (i.e. MAXUINT) bytes. Also added an
	interactive spec so it can be called as a command

	* unix_processes.c (cmd_run_process): renamed as call-process

	* unix_misc.c, amiga_misc.c (cmd_file_size): new function that
	return the size of a specified file. The Amiga version is totally
	untested and probably wrong

	* io.c (cmd_write_buffer, cmd_write_buffer_area): both functions
	now accept streams for output, as well as the original file name
	interface

	* lisp.h (VIEWP): now checks if vw_Win pointer is non-null;
	this happens when the view has been destroyed but is still in
	scope.

	* views.c (view_prin): prints "#<dead-view>" for views that
	have been destroyed

Fri Sep 19 00:48:20 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* find.c (buffer_strpbrk, buffer_reverse_strpbrk, buffer_strchr,
	buffer_reverse_strchr, buffer_compare_n, forward_char,
	backward_char): new buffer utility functions. Used mainly by the
	new regexp matcher

	* find.c: Most of the lisp functions have been rewritten to use
	the new regexp matcher. All functions now allow matches across
	line boundaries (including string and char variants)
	find-{next,prev}-string both set the match-start and match-end
	variables.

	* editcommands.c (sym_flatten_table): variable containing a
 	translation table that converts newlines to spaces

Thu Sep 18 21:06:05 1997  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* movement.c (prev_char, delete_char): deleted these functions,
	they're replaced by forward_char and backward_char in find.c

	* edit.c (delete_section): doesn't trash the `startPos' and
	`endPos' parameters anymore

Sun Sep 14 19:39:50 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* views.c (cmd_view_dimensions, cmd_set_view_dimensions):
	commands for reading and manipulating the size of a view
	(set_scroll_steps): checks that the scroll step isn't greater
	than the width/height of the view

	* windows.c (cmd_window_dimensions): returns the glyph
	dimensions of a window

	* movement.c (cmd_mouse_pos): now adds in vw_StartCol

Sat Sep 13 11:55:23 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* edit.c (check_pos, check_line, check_section): when these
	functions return FALSE they also signal an error. Also
	check_pos() now returns FALSE (not void), when the line is out
	of range

	* find.c, movement.c, editcommands.c: now check the return
	value of check_pos()

	* lisp.c (sym_invalid_pos): new error symbol

	* buffers.c (cmd_restrict_buffer): now calls
	cmd_unrestrict_buffer() before checking the validity of the
	specified section. Otherwise anything outside the current
	restriction will be rejected.

Mon Sep  8 00:24:47 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* unix_misc.c (cmd_system_name): try harder to get a fully
	qualified host name (with domain information)

Sun Sep  7 00:05:37 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* views.c (update_status_buffer): surrounds the cursor
	position with square brackets when a restriction is in effect

	* streams.c: all streams using buffers take note of any
	restriction to that buffer

	* io.c (read_buffer): clears any restriction before reading
	(write_buffer): option to only write restricted text

	* edit.c (check_pos, check_line, check_section): region being
	validated must be inside any restriction

	* movement.c, editcommands.c, find.c: restrict parts of the
	buffer that may be used to the restriction (if it exists)

	* buffers.c (cmd_in_restriction_p): new function; a predicate
	on whether a position is in the restricted part of a buffer

	* buffers.c (cmd_restriction_end): now does what it is
	documented as doing, returns the last character of the line
	before tx_LogicalEnd

	* movement.c (cmd_buffer_end): when I-R-P is null just return
	the value of restriction-end

Sat Sep  6 13:34:55 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* housekeeping.c (adjust_marks_add_y): doesn't shift
	tx_LogicalStart if it equals the insertion line

	* buffers.c (cmd_restrict_buffer, cmd_unrestrict_buffer,
	cmd_restriction_start, cmd_restriction_end): new functions to
	work with tx_LogicalStart and tx_LogicalEnd

	* edit.h (TX): added tx_LogicalStart and tx_LogicalEnd fields;
	the line numbers of the first and last+1 lines that may be
	displayed in the buffer

	* movement.c (cmd_buffer_end, cmd_buffer_start): extra
	argument IGNORE-RESTRICTION-P
	(cmd_centre_display, cmd_goto_buffer_end,
	cmd_goto_buffer_start, cmd_goto_next_line, cmd_goto_prev_line,
	move_down_screens, move_up_screens): modified to work with
	buffer restrictions

	* housekeeping.c (adjust_marks_add_y, adjust_marks_sub_y,
	adjust_marks_split_y, adjust_marks_join_y, resync_y): modified
	to work with buffer restrictions

	* io.c (read_tx): sets the buffer restriction to the entire
	file initially.

	* edit.c (clear_line_list): initialises restriction

	* render.c: ensure that nothing outside the restriction is
	rendered.

	* All files are now under RCS control, not before time

Fri Sep  5 20:06:32 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* view.c (update_status_buffer): fixed display "line" or 
	"lines" depending on the number of lines in the buffer

Thu Sep  4 00:11:59 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* command.c (sym_pre_command_hook, sym_post_command_hook,
	cmd_call_command): these two hooks bracket the evaluation of
	each command. pre-command-hook is given the command to be
	called as its sole arg.

	* keys.c (usekey): calls pre-command-hook and
	post-command-hook around insertion of unbound keys.

Wed Sep  3 20:41:19 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* render.c (redraw_status_buffer): when VWFF_CUSTOM_STATUS is
	set draw the status line in the highlight colour to make it
	stand out.

	* lispmach.c, bytecodes.h: renamed quite a few opcodes. Also
	changed the op-setq and op-set (previously op-vsetc and
	op-vset) instructions to the set value on the stack.

Wed Sep  3 15:53:37 1997  John Harper  (john@gem)

	* stringmem.c, stringmem.h: some general cleaning up of the
	code. Only notable change is that when STRMEM_STATS is defined
	it now prints the statistics when sm_kill() is invoked.

	* revision.h: bumped version to 4.0 alpha

Tue Sep  2 23:38:39 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* bytecodes.h: new header file defining all bytecodes in
	lispmach.c

	* lispmach.c (unbind_one_level): new function that handles
	undoing the first element in the `bindstack'. It can handle
	symbol bindings, unwind-protect forms, and binding to buffers,
	views and windows. OP_UNWIND calls this function.
	(OP_BIND_BUFFER, OP_BIND_VIEW, OP_BIND_WINDOW): these opcodes
	replace the OP_SWAP_X opcodes. They install their sole
	argument (on the stack) (a buffer, view or window) and add an
	entry to the bindstack to let it be unwound later.
	(OP_UN_UNWIND_PRO): removed, OP_UNWIND does this now.

Mon Sep  1 21:52:48 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* lisp.c (max_lisp_depth): doubled to 500, the compiler was
	catching the limit sometimes

	* lispcommands.c (cmd_if, cmd_when, cmd_unless): removed;
	these are now defined as macros in lisp.jl

	* view.c (update_views_dimensions): won't abort if vertical
	size is still the same but horizontal has changed

Sun Aug 31 11:12:09 1997  John Harper  (john@orcrist)

	* Makefile.in: removed *commandline.c; added views.c

	* amiga_commandline.c, commandline.c, x11_commandline.c:
	banished to the obsolete directory (not before time)

	* buffers.c (first_buffer): creates the buffer before the
	window, this lets make-view find at least one buffer in
	existence.

	(get_tx_cursor): now checks active-view, other views in the
	same window, then views in other windows.

	(cmd_current_buffer, cmd_set_current_buffer): now operate on
	views not windows

	(cmd_set_buffer_file_name, cmd_set_buffer_name,
	cmd_set_buffer_modified, cmd_set_buffer_special,
	cmd_set_buffer_read_only, var_mode_name, var_minor_mode_names):
	all set the flag TXFF_REFRESH_STATUS to show that any status
	lines reflecting this buffer may need updating.

	(cmd_with_buffer): saves the current view so that the reset
	stage works when the active view changes. I don't think this
	works in the compiled version properly..

	* configs/: all config-*.h files now have an extra Makefile
	entry, EXTRA_LIBS

	* edit.c (resize_line_list): uses memset() not bzero()

	* edit.h (TX): new flag TXFF_REFRESH_STATUS -- reflects when a
	view displaying the buffer needs to refresh its status display

	(VW): now represents a single view in a window, as such all
	window system data has been removed. Has a `vw_NextView' field
	pointing to the view beneath it in the window. `vw_MaxY' and 
	`vw_MaxX' refer to the size of the view.
	The flags VWFF_SLEEPING and VWFF_MESSAGE have been removed;
	new flags VWFF_MINIBUF and VWFF_CUSTOM_STATUS have been added.

	(WIN): new structure representing a physical window (what
	Emacs would call a frame). Most things are those that were
	removed from the VW. `w_ViewList' points to the top view in
	the window, `w_CurrVW' to the current view, and `w_MiniBuf' to
	the minibuffer view.

	(MINIBUFFER_ACTIVE_P(win)): macro to check if a window's
	minibuffer view is in use.

	* editcommands.c (sym_block_status_hook): hook called when the
	current view's block status changes; one argument the block
	status.

	* editrect.c (cmd_insert_rect): tries to return the position
	following the insertion; not so useful as it doesn't lead to
	the size of the rectangle.

	* lisp.c (sym_window_error): new error type

	* lisp.h (V_View, VVIEW, VIEWP): define the view type

	* lispmach.c (OP_VIEWP, OP_SWAP_VIEW, OP_CURRENT_VIEW,
	OP_SWAP2): new opcodes. swap-buffer has changed incompatibly!,
	but probably still won't work in case of errors

	* movement.c (cmd_centre_display, cmd_mouse_pos): work
	relative to the current view now, not the window.

	* refresh.c (refresh_window) renamed as `refresh_view' and
	made to work on a per-view basis. A new function `
	refresh_window' has been added that cycles through each view
	in a window refreshing each in turn.
	(vert_scroll): calls portable scroll_vw() not sys_scroll_vw()
	(refresh_message): function to redraw a window's message if
	necessary.

	* render.c: all functions work relative to the view now, in
	fact they assume the view is at position (0,0) and let the
	window-system macros (i.e. MOVE, DRAW, etc...) work out where
	the view actually is.  It is also assumed that four pens exist
	now: P_TEXT, P_TEXT_RV, P_BLOCK, and P_BLOCK_RV.
	(redraw_cmd_line, redraw_cmd_line_from, cmd_line_cursor):
	deleted.
	(draw_message_line, redraw_message, redraw_status_buffer):
	added.
	(scroll_vw): portable version of sys_scroll_vw(), uses
	CLR_AREA and COPY_AREA macros

	* streams.c: writing to the message line works on the current
	window, not the current view

	* unix_misc.c: used ENVIRON_UNDEFINED, not ENVIRON_UNDECLARED,
	doh!

	* unix_processes.c: include <signal.h> not <sys/signal.h>,
	also includes <stdio.h> and <fcntl.h>

	* values.c (ValueClasses): entries for V_View
	(mark_value): changed V_Window and V_View actions
	(cmd_garbage_collect): added view_sweep() to list of sweep
	functions.

	* views.c: new file providing view functions
	(view_chain, curr_vw): list of all views, and current view
	(make-view-hook, destroy-view-hook): what they say
	(cmd_make_view, cmd_destroy_view): also what they say
	(update_view_dimension): recalibrates the view dimensions of a
	window after the window size has changed
	(update_status_buffer): reformats the status line
	(cmd_next_view, cmd_previous_view): for traversing views
	(cmd_with_view): similar to `with-window'
	(cmd_minibuffer_view, cmd_minibuffer_view_p,
	cmd_minibuffer_active_p): new functions
	(cmd_set_status_message): allows the hijacking of the status
	line.

	* windows.c: many things changed to use `WIN *' instead of 
	`VW *', some functions moved to the new file views.c
	(win_chain, curr_win): replace `view_chain' and `curr_vw'
	(copy_prefs): renamed `copy_win_prefs'
	(cmd_make_window): creates two views by default, a main view
	with everything but the one row taken by the minibuffer view

	* x11_display.c: includes <signal.h> not <sys/signal.h>
	(x11_high_pixel): pixel colour used to provide P_BLOCK pens
	(x11_jade_sel): property used to transfer selection's atom
	(x11_get_options): `-hl' for highlight pixel
	(handle_event): works in windows not views, now handles
	MotionNotify, SelectionRequest, and SelectionClear events.
	(event_loop): in the timeout try to remove messages from
	minibuffers if the minibuffer is active.

	* x11_keys.c (translate_event): handles MotionNotify events
	(KeyDescr): remove pounds-sterling sign; it seems that Solaris
	strcasecmp() only works with 7-bit ASCII?

	* x11_misc.c (x11_convert_selection, x11_lose_selection,
	cmd_x11_set_selection, cmd_x11_selection_active_p,
	cmd_x11_get_selection, cmd_x11_lose_selection, sym_xa_primary,
	sym_xa_secondary, x11_misc_init): selection handling

	* x11_render.c (redraw_exposed_area): new function; given a
	window and a rectangular region, works out which bits in each
	view need redrawing, and redraws them.
	(sys_scroll_vw): deleted

	* x11_windows.c (INPUT_EVENTS): added ButtonMotionMask and
	PointerMotionHintMask.
	(sys_sleep_vw, sys_unsleep_vw, sys_set_vw_pos): renamed
	`sys_sleep_win', `sys_unsleep_win', and 'sys_set_win_pos'
	(sys_new_window): creates GCs for all four pens

	* x11_windowsys.h (W_WindowSys): new entry ws_GC_array[] which
	holds all GCs.
	(P_TEXT, P_TEXT_RV, P_BLOCK, P_BLOCK_RV, P_MAX): defined
	(MOVE, PEN_X, PEN_Y, CLR_AREA, CLR_RECT, SET_AREA, SET_RECT,
	COPY_AREA, DRAW_LINE): all coordinates are relative to the
	specified view. SET_{RECT,AREA} now take a PEN argument
	defining the GC to use.

Thu Jul 13 11:56:35 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* Makefile.in: fixed the _JADE_DIR macro containing a leading
	space character.

	* unix_defs.h, unix_server.c, unix_client.c (JADE_SOCK_NAME):
	This is now defined in the unix_defs.h header file to prevent
	any more embarassing mistakes (changing its definition in only
	one place)

	* render.c (clear_lines): New function

	* refresh.c (flag_deletion): The tx_ModEnd is set to the end
	of the deleted text, not the same place as the beginning of
	the deletion. This fixes the annoying ``delete a block near
	the end of the buffer'' bug which sometimes occurs. What does
	it break though? (it probably hits performance..)

Sun May 28 01:11:57 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* jade.h (QUOTE): Macro to stringify its argument
	* Makefile.in, unix_defs.h (_JADE_DIR, JADE_DIR): Due to rot
	in cpp the method of passing in JADE_DIR broke. Now it's
	passed from the command line without quotes. The definitions
	of LISP_LIB_DIR and DOC_FILE quote it.

Wed Feb 22 20:15:18 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* movement.c (next_char): When POS is past the end of the line
	move it back to the end.

Thu Jan 12 16:27:23 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_divide, cmd_remainder): Now check for
	divide-by-zero and signal an error if it will occur.

Wed Jan 11 14:43:33 1995  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* commands.c (interactive_spec): Doesn't assume that lambda
	expressions are always valid anymore

Sat Dec 24 15:46:52 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* render.c (draw_line_glyph_length, draw_rect): Hopefully
	fixed the problem of the glyph in the right-most column
	sometimes being left undrawn.

Sun Nov 13 19:48:55 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* buffers.c (var_auto_save_interval): corrected its doc-string

Sun Oct 30 15:24:16 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* x11_windows.c (sys_new_window): windows are now called `Jade'

Wed Oct 26 17:52:44 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* unix_client.c (JADE_SOCK_NAME): changed to ".Jade_rendezvous";
	I'd changed this in unix_server.c but not here (oops!)

Sun Oct 23 19:54:24 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* windows.c (save_message, restore_message): Mechanism for
	temporarily installing a message.

	* values.c (cmd_garbage_collect): Prints a message while
	gc'ing (again).

	* lisp.c (load_autoload): Temporarily prints a message
	while loading the file.

	* Makefile.in: moved the definitions of CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to
	`../Makefile'; hopefully this means the user can override them
	properly when compiling.

Fri Oct  7 15:12:19 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* Version 3.2 released

Tue Oct  4 00:06:10 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lisp.h, symbols.c, values.c: new type V_Void. Used to denote
	a void value in a symbol.
	
	* symbols.c (cmd_symbol_value, cmd_symbol_function,
	cmd_default_value): these now take an extra argument `NO-ERROR'.
	Unless this is t, when the value is void they signal an error.

	* symbols.c: rewrote buffer-local variables to be compatible
	 with Emacs. Removed `set-buffer-variable' and
	`buffer-variable-p', renamed `delete-buffer-variables' to
	`kill-all-local-variables' and created the new functions,
	`make-local-variable', `make-variable-buffer-local' and
	`kill-local-variable'.
	(cmd_set): SF_BUFFER_LOCAL only means that a variable may
	have a local value; not that one should be created (see next
	entry)

	* lisp.h (SF_SET_BUFFER_LOCAL): new flag, means that setting
	this symbol gives it a buffer-local binding

Mon Oct  3 17:53:07 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* io.c (read_tx): no longer scans for code section
	* buffers.c (eval_file_code): removed
	* editrect.c (col_copy_sect): removed

	* housekeeping.c (set-start-line): this was doing it's own
	rendering; a bad thing all in all

	* Most module's _kill function didn't set that module's private
	chain of objects to NULL. In particular the Amiga menus were
	stepping through the de-allocated view_chain and guruing...

Sat Oct  1 14:48:49 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* amiga_keys.c (lookup_event_name): doesn't pass any qualifiers
	to MapRawKey() anymore

	* commands.c (cmd_call_command): the `N' code-letter was screwed

	* main.c, x11_display.c, amiga_display.c: startup modified so
	that the sys_init() function calls a new function inner_main()
	which does most of what main() used to do. This allows the Amiga
	version of sys_init() to play with the stack

	* amiga_display.c (sys_init): now contains code to allocate a
	larger stack if the `-stack' argument is given.

	* unix_processes.c (run_process): when using pipes stderr is also
	connected up

Thu Sep 29 15:33:23 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* unix_processes.c (cmd_signal_process, cmd_interrupt_process,
	cmd_kill_process, cmd_stop_process, cmd_continue_process): All
	have a new argument, SIGNAL-GROUP, which makes them signal the
	whole process group.

Mon Sep 26 21:13:32 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* unix_processes.c (cmd_make_process): default value of the
	connection-type component is now `pipe'

Tue Sep 20 14:22:22 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* refresh.c (refresh_world_curs): no longer makes an ill-judged
	guess as to whether a window should be refreshed or not; sometimes
	it got it wrong :-(

	* keys.c (var_next_keymap_path): now passes the prefix-arg through
	the chain of multi-key bindings

	* x11_keys.c, amiga_keys.c (lookup_event): doesn't look for backslash
	characters anymore, also a `-' character as the first character in
	a token won't terminate the token.

Sun Sep 18 15:37:00 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* misc.c (cmd_file_concat): renamed as `file-name-concat'

Wed Sep 14 15:08:52 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* misc.c (cmd_path_name, cmd_base_name): renamed as `file-name-
	directory' and `file-name-nondirectory' respectively

	* symbols.c (bind_symbol, unbind_symbols): uses the `set-default'
	and `default-value' functions to bind variables
	(cmd_set_default, cmd_default_value): now checks for a V_Var type
	of object

Tue Sep 13 15:10:56 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* unix_misc.c, amiga_misc.c (cmd_setenv): new function

	* housekeeping.c (resync_y): checks for a blank area at the
	bottom of the display; if one exists it's removed

Fri Sep  9 14:59:16 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* render.c (cut_paste_lines): when deleting lines, and the stuff
	which couldn't be blitted is only partly in the buffer, the rest is
	cleared.
	(cut_paste_lines): doesn't check if `srcLine' is greater than
	the last line displayed anymore; this is perfectly valid

Tue Sep  6 14:47:48 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* housekeeping.c (resync_y): when the cursor goes totally out
	of the display its put back at the center of the screen.

	* unix_server.c, amiga_server.c (cmd_server_open, cmd_server_close):
	these can now be called interactively

Sat Sep  3 15:50:18 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* find.c (replaceit): now expands the replacement before deleting
	the original text; a much better idea (i.e. it works)

Thu Sep  1 14:17:57 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* commands.c (cmd_interactive): now a special form

Wed Aug 31 20:28:06 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* x11_eventloop.c, amiga_eventloop.c: the hook `close-gadget-hook'
	has been renamed to `window-closed-hook'.

Tue Aug 30 11:47:17 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* keys.c (cmd_bind_keys, cmd_unbind_keys): the KEY-DESCRIPTION
	may now be an event

	* keys.h: redefined the EV_TYPE and EV_MOD defines so that
	most events will fit this field into 8 bits, and hence will
	use the pre-allocated static integers to save memory.

Mon Aug 29 12:47:47 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* glyphs.c (cmd_set_glyph): when a glyph-string of "" is
	set the first glyph is set to ' '
	(cmd_glyph_to_char_pos): POS isn't optional anymore

	* buffers.c (mark_prin): doesn't add one to the marks line and
	column before printing them anymore. Also resident marks have
	their buffer printed not their name
	(cmd_set_mark): setting the name of the file should work now

Tue Aug 23 13:11:34 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_bit_not, cmd_bit_or, cmd_bit_and): renamed
	as `lognot', `logior' and `logand' respectively.

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_logxor): new function
	* lispmach.c (OP_LOGXOR_2): new opcode

Thu Aug 18 16:20:48 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

Wed Aug 17 14:30:17 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_defvar, cmd_defconst): the default value of
	buffer-local variables is set, not the local value
	(cmd_list): now conses up a *new* list, doesn't use its arg list;
	this could be risky
	(cmd_apply): now signals an error if its last argument is not
	a list

Tue Aug 16 19:32:02 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* symbols.c (cmd_default_boundp, cmd_set_default): new functions

Sun Aug 14 19:45:52 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* symbols.c: obarrays no longer use NULL to terminate a bucket: any
	non-symbol object can be used instead. This means that having a
	NULL sym_Next can signify that a symbol is not interned, making
	the SF_INTERNED flag obsolete -- it's been removed.

	* symbols.c (var_obarray): new variable -- provides access
	to the default obarray

Sat Aug 13 12:40:00 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* glyphs.c (cmd_glyph_table_p): new function

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_reverse): this was totally screwed
	(cmd_aref, cmd_aset): changed documentation

	* editcmds.c (cmd_alpha_char_p, cmd_upper_case_p, cmd_lower_case_p,
	cmd_digit_char_p, cmd_alphanumericp, cmd_space_char_p): these now
	accept non-integer arguments -- they just return nil for them.

Fri Aug 12 14:09:06 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* x11_display.c (x11_text_cursor): cursor to use in all windows

Thu Aug 11 20:13:10 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_mod): this was actually a remainder function
	not modulo; it's renamed to `%'
	(cmd_lsh): this was actually an arithmetic shift, new function
	`ash' to do this and lsh is fixed
	(cmd_integerp): new function

Sun Jul 17 13:46:40 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* movement.c (cmd_next_char, cmd_goto_next_char, cmd_prev_char,
	cmd_goto_prev_char): now take a COUNT argument: the number
	of characters to move. The new args to next-char and prev-char
	are incompatible with the old ones :-(

Fri Jul 15 15:01:20 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lisp.c (lisp_init): int_cell is now (user-interrupt)
	not (error user-interrupt). This means that interrupts are no
	longer errors and therefore are unable to be caught by error-pro.
	* x11_eventloop.c, amiga_eventloop.c (event_loop): checks for
	explicitly for user-interrupt

Thu Jul 14 15:54:10 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* unix_server.c (server_accept_connection): the connection fd is
	marked to be discarded on exec()

Tue Jul 12 13:05:08 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* amiga_menus.c (cmd_set_menu): the action of the menu is a command
	not a list of forms

	* undo.c (undo_trim): when an undo is in progress tries to
	truncate the oldest of the three undo-lists

	* lispmach.c (CALL_1, CALL_2, CALL_3): macros containing the code
	to call a function for an instruction. Lots more opcodes have
	been added.	

Mon Jul 11 11:53:56 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* edit.c (pad_pos): now adds the insertion to the buffer's undo-list

	* undo.c: doesn't use prefix counts to group items anymore. Instead
	a marker (`nil') is placed between each group. This lets me make
	each command a separate undo-group; also undo through several
	recursive edits works properly.

	* commands.c (var_last_command): no longer checks if VAL is nil

Sun Jul 10 20:06:15 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* keys.c (print_event_prefix): now prints the whole sequence
	each time.

	* commands.c: New file; stuff for interactive function calling

	* streams.c (stream_puts, stream_putc): When writing to a string
	an extra byte is allocated to hold the zero terminator
	(cmd_format): writes each chunk of characters between format
	specifiers as one string instead of individually

Wed Jul  6 19:32:31 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* streams.c (cmd_format): with a STREAM of nil a string is
	constructed.

	* edit.h, symbols.c, windows.c: Window-local Lisp variables are
	no longer supported; they were only used for one variable, the
	`buffer-list'. This variable is now an entry in the VW structure.

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_aset): doesn't modify V_StaticString's

	* editcommands.c (cmd_translate_string): checks for read-only
	strings

	* lisp.h (STRING_WRITEABLE_P): macro to check if a Lisp string
	may be modified.

Sun Jul  3 15:08:17 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_defconst): an error is signalled if the symbol
	is already bound.

	* refresh.c (refresh_window): when a deletion is recognised the line
	it occurs is *always* redrawn from the first char deleted.

	* misc.c (cmd_expand_file_name): new arg, QUALIFY-FULLY. When t
	this says to get an absolute name.
	* amiga_misc.c, unix_misc.c (sys_fully_qualify_file_name): new
	function for the above Lisp function.

	* movement.c: (cmd_file_start, cmd_file_end, cmd_goto_file_start,
	cmd_goto_file_end): renamed, ``file'' replaced by ``buffer''

Fri Jul  1 10:51:45 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* refresh.c (flag_deletion): tx_ModEnd is set to the start of the
	deletion not the end
	(refresh_window): when (tx_ModDelta < 0) (i.e. a deletion) the
	cut & paste operation is a bit different now (hopefully this way
	works!?)

	* render.c (redraw_region): returns immediately when (START == END)

	* editcommands.c (sym_inhibit_read_only): new variable
	* edit.c (read_only): takes note of `inhibit-read-only' when it's
	bound and non-nil.

Wed Jun 29 16:48:46 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* Major alterations to all files; I've tried to impose
	a sensible naming style onto all symbols. All global
	symbols have a prefix. This is either null for files
	common to all configurations, `x11_' for stuff accessed
	only by the X files, likewise for `unix_' and `ami_'.
	The `sys_' prefix is for things which are accessed from
	the common area but exists in one of the non-common
	files.

	* x11_windowsys.h, amiga_windowsys.h (DRAW_LINE): new macro,
	draws a 1-pixel wide line
	* render.c, x11_render.c, amiga_render.c, x11_windows.c,
	amiga_windows.c: all stuff to do with the status/message line
	is made system-independant. This means that messages on the
	Amiga now use the bottom line of the window as in X

	* amiga_eventloop.c (eventloop): in idle timeout calls
	print_event_prefix() and also refreshes the display if
	necessary.

	* amiga_keys.c (lookup_event_name): uses MapRawKey() to
	decipher unknown keycodes.

	* amiga_eventloop.c (eventloop): calls undo_distinct() when
	the current window changes

	* amiga_defs.h (TEST_INT): tests for SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C and calls
	amiga_interrupt_handler()
	* amiga_display.c (amiga_interrupt_handler): new function, resets
	the ^C signal bit and throws an interrupt

	* unix_processes.c (proc_notification): now blocks sigchld

	* keys.c (usekey): unbound insertions now set the last-command
	variable to t.

	* undo.c: now records when a buffer changes from un-modified
	to modified so this too can be undone.

Mon Jun 20 22:23:46 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* undo.c: new file, undo recording and undo-ing
	* Wherever flag*tion() is called undo_record_*tion() is also
	called.
	* x11_eventloop.c (eventloop): calls undo_distinct() when the
	current window changes

	* editcommands.c (cmd_insert): now returns the position of the
	end of the insertion

Sat Jun 18 11:54:50 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lisp.c (read_str): an escaped newline is now ignored
	(read_symbol): checks that its static buffer doesn't overflow

	* x11_windows.c (unsleep): this may work now?
	(sleepwin, unsleep): now use the VWFF_SLEEPING flag
	* x11_eventloop.c (handleevent): if we get an Expose event while
	sleeping assume that we woke up. Also if the VWFF_FORCE_REFRESH
	flag is set we discard all Expose events, when one has a count of
	zero (the last) do a total redraw of the window

Thu Jun 16 20:18:58 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* refresh.c (refreshwindow): sets vw_LastDisplayOrigin here after

	* windows.c (stdtitle): now calls calc_cursor_offset()

	* find.c (cmd_match_start, cmd_match_end): new functions; these
	replace the variables `find-last-start-pos' and `find-last-end-pos'.
	Now the position of any expression can be found and in strings
	as well as in buffers.

	* editcommands.c (cmd_offset_to_pos, cmd_pos_to_offset): new
	functions for converting between byte counts and positions

	* unix_processes.c (struct Proc): pr_UsePty changed to pr_ConnType
	(runproc): option to set the ECHO flag in a pty

	becomes pr_Args and is now a list of arguments 1..N. Arg #0 is
	taken from pr_Prog
	(cmd_start_process, cmd_run_process): new arg spec. ARGS are now
	passed as the last N args in the call. Also the PROCESS arg

	(cmd_process_name, cmd_set_process_name): renamed to process-prog
	and set-process-prog
	(cmd_process_argv, cmd_set_process_argv): renamed argv to args and
	takes a list instead of a vector

	saying draw it immediately
	(cmd_title_now): removed

	* amiga_keys.c: updated after yesterday's changes, not finished
	yet I can't remember the name of a function I need to use :-(

Thu Jun  9 11:32:49 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* keys.c, keys.h: massive changes; all key/event structures are
	now standard Lisp types (vector & cons cells). Some new functions

	* amiga_misc.c (cmd_file_req): sets the length of the returned string
	to its correct value

	* render.c (cutpastelines): doesn't assume that the window contains
	an integral number of lines -- screen debris was left between the
	end of the last line and the bottom of the window

	* misc.c (memchr): in case the C library doesn't provide memchr(),
	one of mine doesn't :(

	* configs/: new option in all config files `HAVE_MEMCHR'

	* amiga_menus.c (setallmenus, clearallmenus): Didn't ignore window
	objects which don't have a physical window open, this was causing
	Enforcer hits

	* editcommands.c (cmd_set_indent_pos, cmd_indent_to): options
	to only insert spaces, not tabs

	* movement.c: fixed the `tab' functions to work with glyph
	positions

	* stringmem.c (sm_free): when a (non-malloc'd) string is freed
	increment DataAfterGC by its size

Sun May 22 23:13:10 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* values.c (cmd_garbage_collect): calls sm_flush() on the MainStrMem
	block.

	* buffers.c (cmd_destroy_buffer): doesn't bother calling sm_flush()
	anymore

Sat May 21 20:59:11 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* refresh.c (refreshworldcurs): doesn't try to setvwtitle()
	closed windows anymore

Fri May 20 21:52:37 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* configs: added HAVE_SETPGID and HAVE_SETPGRP options
	* unix_processes.c: takes note of the above macros

Thu May 19 21:02:06 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* unix_client.c, amiga_client.c (main): resets the line number for
	each file.

	* x11_windows.c (cmd_window_left_edge, cmd_window_top_edge): these
	used to return coordinates relative to our parent window (created
	by the wm) not the root window.

Sun May 15 00:30:48 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lispmach.c: new instruction OP_RETURN

	* find.c (replacit, replaceitstr): calls flaginsertion() before
	inserting the string not after (when the pos has been advanced)

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_unwind_protect): temporarily sets `ThrowValue' to
	NULL while evaluating the body.
	* lispmach.c (cmd_lisp_code2): similar to the above when unwinding

Fri May 13 21:52:40 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* editcommands.c (cmd_set_char): new function

Thu May 12 19:24:22 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	compiled forms are now different.

	* lisp.c (string_print): no longer escapes tabs or newlines

	* editcommands.c (cmd_translate_string, cmd_get_char): new
	functions.

Tue May 10 21:19:29 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lisp.h, value.h: New definition of the VALUE type, no longer
	is it (void *)

Sun May  8 18:42:03 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* editrect.c: New file. Most rectangle code has moved here from
	edit.c and updated to cope with the fact that a character's position 
	in a line may not be the same as its position on the screen. Also 
	lots of TAB handling.

	* keys.c (evalbinding): if the symbol `meta-sends-esc' is non-nil
	any meta-modified events get translated into ESC then the
	un-meta'd event.

Sat May  7 13:53:59 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* glyphs.c: each buffer can now have its own glyph-table. A new
	data type for glyph-tables has been created. New functions to
	manipulate these.

Fri May  6 20:31:33 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* editcommands.c (cmd_indent_to): new function

	* edit.c: changes uses of strcpy() and family to memcpy() so
	nul bytes don't cause havoc.

Thu May  5 17:08:23 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* unix_processes.c (writetoproc): new arg BUFLEN

	* streams.c (stream_puts): new arg BUFLEN, the length of the
	string being written
	(stream_read_esc): now understands octal escapes of less than 3
	chars and hex escapes

	* lisp.h: strings allocated (as opposed to being string-constants)
	now contain a length field. This will allow these strings to
	contain '\000' characters. The macro STRING_LEN gives the number
	of characters in any type of Lisp string.

	* values.c: accommodate the above changes

	* io.c (cmd_write_file): uses fwrite() not fputs

Wed May  4 20:28:31 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* edit.c (posinblock): for rectangular blocks uses glyph coords

	* housekeeping.c: the block marks are only updated in the y direction
        if rectangular blocks are being marked.

	* render.c (draw_bit): END arg is now inclusive

	* amiga_misc.c, unix_misc.c (fileexists): now returns bool

Tue May  3 08:30:52 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* buffers.c (var_disk_tab, var_save_tabs): removed
	(var_screen_tab): renamed as var_tab_size

	* edit.h (struct _TX): removed tx_DiskTab and tx_SaveTabs :)

	* movement.c (cmd_next_tab, cmd_goto_next_tab, cmd_prev_tab,
	cmd_goto_prev_tab): new arg TAB-SIZE. Also the goto variants
	convert glyph-pos to char-pos. The other return the *glyph* pos.

	* find.c (strrchrn, strrstrn): renamed as mystrrchrn() and
	mystrrstrn() incase they clash with anyone's C library

	* misc.c (stpblk, stpalnum, cpyalnum): deleted, they were
	not used anymore

	* find.c (mystricmp): args toupper() and tolower() had side
	effects! Deleted this function since it's not used anymore
	anyway

	* housekeeping.c: #undef's no longer state the macro's args,
	I'm told this is illegal

	* movement.c (cmd_goto): renamed as cmd_goto_char
	(cmd_goto_glyph): new function

	* editcommands.c (cmd_indent_pos, cmd_set_indent_pos): hacked
	to allow `proper' TABs

	* edit.c (insertstring): no longer has to expand TAB chars.

	* io.c (readtx): rewritten, no longer has to expand TAB chars,
	should make it a lot faster?
	(writeline): not needed anymore

	* render.c: many changes to cope with the `glyphs' code, now
	there are two types of column position, the `character' one
	which is the number of characters from the start of the line, and
	the `glyph' pos, the number of glyphs from the start of the
	line.

	* glyphs.c: new file, manages mappings between characters and
	their printed representations. Includes new Lisp functions,
	`glyph-to-char-pos', `char-to-glyph-pos', `set-glyph' and
	`get-glyph'.

Mon May	 2 10:13:12 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* windows.c (stdtitle): bracketing around mode names now shows
	if in a recursive-edit

	* values.c (cmd_dup_pos): renamed as cmd_copy_pos

	* streams.c (streamputc, streamputs): strings now have a number
	associated with them, their *actual* size.

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_rassoc, cmd_rassq): new functions
	(cmd_copy_string): new function

Sun May	 1 23:36:00 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lisp.c: Optimised some of the read functions, got rid of the
	nextlispexp() function.

Sat Apr 30 10:44:56 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* symbols.c (symbols_init): nil and t are now constants

	* windows.c (cmd_make_window): only calls updatescroller() if
	tx is non-NULL, should fix the other Enforcer hit?

	* buffers.c (firstbuffer): now calls updatescroller() *after*
	switching in the first buffer, I think this should kill the
	Enforcer hit at startup?

	* refresh.c (refreshworldcurs): updates status line properly

	* edit.c (checksect, checkpos, checkline): didn't make sure the
	line number was positive

	* unix_client.c: now takes a series of files

	* amiga_eventloop.c (eventloop): Wait()'s for ServerSig as well

	* amiga_server.c, amiga_client.c: new files (untested, as yet)

Fri Apr 29 21:38:03 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* unix_server.c, unix_client.c: new files

Thu Apr 28 19:21:43 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* amiga_defs.h, unix_defs.h (DOC_FILE): renamed as DOC

	* unix_misc.c (geterrstring): macro HAVE_STRERROR replaces
	 ERRNO_STRING, much simpler.

Thu Apr 28 14:39:49 1994  J.S.Harper  (jsh@raven.ukc.ac.uk)

	* render.c (cutpastelines): fixed one [more] bug

Thu Apr 28 01:26:58 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* editcommands.c (cmd_delete_area, cmd_cut_area): these now
	call padpos() on their section markers.

Wed Apr 27 19:53:27 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* unix_memory.c, unix_defs.h (myfree, initmem, killmem): these are
	now macros in unix_defs.h

Tue Apr 26 22:59:44 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* Makefile.in: new file, cpp source to make src/Makefile. Now only
	one configuration file has to be edited, src/config.h, it's used
	for both Makefile and C configurations.

Mon Apr 25 22:14:41 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* keys.c (cmd_current_key_string): new function

	* buffers.c (var_minor_mode_names): list of strings which is printed
	in the status line.
	* edit.h (TX): tx_MinorModeNameList and tx_MinorModeNameString

Sun Apr 24 13:06:56 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* unix_misc.c (cmd_directory_files): oops. If it couldn't open the
	named dir, it signalled the error with the C-string not the Lisp one.

	* misc.c (cmd_expand_file_name): new function
	* unix_misc.c (expand_file_name): does the work of the above function
	* unix_defs.h: #define EXPAND_FILE_NAME expand_file_name

	* unix_processes.c (runproc): initialises the pty more carefully

	* streams.c (posputc, posputs): uses `tx_DiskTab' for tab size, not
	`tx_TabSize'. What will this break?

Sat Apr 23 21:05:34 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_defvar, cmd_defconst): these are now in C

	* find.c (cmd_looking_at): used to set `find-last-end-pos' to the
	wrong position, also, the NOCASE_P arg was being ignored.

Wed Apr 20 16:02:28 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* Version 3.0 released

Tue Apr 19 20:51:28 1994  John Harper  (jsh@deep)

	* refresh.c (refreshworldcurs): Checks if buffer has switched

	* amiga_minrexx.c (disp_rexx_port): changed the way that results are
	returned. Numbers and Strings are returned via RESULT. `nil'
	means RC=1 (command failed), anything else RC=0 (command succeeded).

Mon Apr 18 20:54:42 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lisp.c (LispDepth, MaxLispDepth, var_max_lisp_depth, _eval, funcall):
	Protection against infinite recursion.

Mon Apr 18 11:13:52 1994  John Harper  (jsh@deep)

	* prefs.c (copyfileprefs): by default `save-tabs' is 'all

Sun Apr 17 19:29:37 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* refresh.c (refreshwindow): simpler way of checking if block has
	already been drawn. Not good, but it may actually work!

	* render.c (cursor): checks if cursor is off bottom of window

	* x11_commandline.c (docmdline): now redraws the separator line
	on an expose event.

	* unix_misc.c, amiga_misc.c (cmd_move_file): renamed to
	`cmd_rename_file'.

	* unix_misc.c, amiga_misc.c (cmd_copy_file, cmd_file_nlinks,
	cmd_file_modes, cmd_set_file_modes): New functions

Sat Apr 16 14:04:45 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* Added license notices at the beginning of all source files.

	* All instances of the string `jed' have been changed to `jade'. I
	decided to change its name since there is at least one other editor
	called jed.

Fri Apr 15 14:35:55 1994  John Harper  (jsh@deep)

	* amiga_windows.c (newwindow, sleepwin): `DefDims' contains the
	number of rows/columns, not pixels.

	* amiga_display.c (initwinsys): Command line arguments `-pubscreen'
	and `-font'

Thu Apr 14 20:23:27 1994  John Harper  (jsh@deep)

	* values.c (values_kill): Due to a typo blocks of Numbers weren't being
	deallocated, now they are.

	* amiga_eventloop.c (eventloop): Fixed idle test. It's not ideal
	-- it uses 10 Intuiticks equal one second. Of course, the main
	loss is that Intuiticks are only sent while one of our windows is
	active :-(

Thu Apr 14 11:31:49 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* amiga_menus.c: More or less wholly rewritten. Doesn't take menu
	definitions from a file anymore, but from a list. No support for
	submenus at the moment though.

	* buffers.c (makemarksres, makemarksnonres): Don't bother checking
	for a NULL `tx_FileName', this can't happen.

	* values.c (markvalue): Marks don't get gc-marked down their
	chain, this was wrong.
	* buffers.c (sweep_mark, unchainmark): To go with the above, marks
	are now unchained from their buffer when swept.

	* misc.c (cmd_file_concat): function to stick together
	path-name components.
	* amiga_misc.c, unix_misc.c (addfilepart): for the above function

Wed Apr 13 11:31:45 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* symbols.c (bindsymbol, unbindsymbols): Can now bind to V_Var
	objects properly (the function is used to retrieve and set its
	value)

Tue Apr 12 14:55:56 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* x11_windowsys.h: CLR_RECT and SET_RECT did one two many columns/rows

	* find.c (cmd_looking_at): new function

Mon Apr 11 23:17:56 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* symbols.c: `make-*-variable' functions have been changed to
	`set-*-variable'. They don't make anything, just set a flag.

Sun Apr 10 19:22:35 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* find.c (strrchrn): Now uses a pointer instead of an array index.

Fri Apr	 8 20:21:07 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* symbols.c (cmd_symbol_value, symbol_function): Got rid of the
	`void-symbol-function' hook.

Tue Apr 05 15:19:47 1994  John Harper  (jsh@deep)

	* amiga_windows.c (cmd_font_size): Removed, obsoleted by the
	`font-y-size' function

	* windows.c (cmd_font_x_size, cmd_font_y_size): New commands

	* amiga_misc.c (cmd_full_name): No longer returns NULL when it
	can't read the ENV: variable `REALNAME'.

	* amiga_clipboard.c: Errors now reported via signal, not just printed
	in the status line.
	(readclip): Used to return a normal string not a VALUE

Mon Apr	 4 12:40:00 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* Makefile, DMakefile: Now *all* source files are scanned for
	doc-strings. This is so that there is only one `DOC-strings' file
	for any particular revision (not one for each target OS).

Sun Apr	 3 20:57:24 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* main.c, x11_eventloop.c, amiga_eventloop.c: Now eventloop() calls
	refreshworldcurs() when it is entered, this used to be done in
	cmd_recursive_edit() (but not in main()).

Thu Mar 31 12:27:21 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* Files in the directories `amiga/', `unix/' and `x11/' have been
	moved into the root source dir with prefixes of `amiga_', `unix_' and
	`x11_' respectively. This makes compilation a lot easier.

Tue Mar 29 00:45:13 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* render.c: As much as possible of x11/render.c has been moved to
	here. Uses macros defined in windowsys.h to do as much platform-
	independant rendering as possible. This turns out to be everything
	but the prompt line.

	* refresh.c: Copied most of render.c into this file.

Fri Mar 25 13:20:11 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* x11/eventloop.c: increasing the vertical size of a window no longer
	leaves the old status line in the middle of the display (if the buffer
	doesn't overwrite it).

	* values.c (cons_sweep): wholly unused blocks are now freed
	(markvalue): attempt to limit recursion as much as possible

Thu Mar 24 09:51:07 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* symbols.c: Got rid of `symbol-flags' function. Now there's none
	of these annoying `flags' functions left :-)

	* buffers.c: TXFF_IMMORTAL and TXFF_NOCHANGE are consolidated
	into TXFF_SPECIAL. New functions `set-buffer-special' and
	`buffer-special-p'. Got rid of `tx-flags' function.
	(set-buffer-name, set-file-name): Order of arguments reversed,
	this is more consistent with all other `set*' functions.

	* files.c: renamed to buffers.c, this makes more sense now

Wed Mar 23 12:06:02 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* values.c (markvalue): Two new algorithms for marking cons cells

	* General code cleanup so that it will compile with -Wparentheses.

Sat Mar 19 03:45:03 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* find.c (cmd_find_next_regexp, cmd_find_prev_regexp, cmd_regexp_match,
	cmd_regexp_match_line): optional arg `IGNORE-CASE-P'

	* regexp/regexp.h, regexp/regexp.c: new flag to regexec2(),
	REG_NOCASE, means ignore case when comparing strings (but not
	for character classes).

	* io.c: new command `read-file-from-to'

	* streams.c: new commands `read-line' and `read-file-until'

Fri Mar 18 01:03:28 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* doc/: Directory with manual stuff, new Makefile

	* find.c: New command `regexp-expand-line' a cross between
	`regexp-expand' and `regexp-match-line'.

Thu Mar 17 18:55:54 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* jed.h, windows.c: Got rid of obsolete VWFF_NOSAVEPOS flag. Also
	the var `vw-flags' is gone. Functions `rect-blocks-p' and
	`set-rect-blocks' are used instead (the other flags are internal).

	* unix/processes.c: Now uses SA_RESTART if possible and O_NONBLOCK
	instead of O_NDELAY.

Tue Mar 15 23:04:34 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* jed.texi: New file, at last! I've started the manual

	* files.c (var_save_tabs): Now uses descriptive symbols for the
	options, not magic numbers.

Mon Mar 14 21:21:41 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* unix/processes.c: Now uses sigaction() and sigprocmask() instead
	of signal(). I'm not sure if I've done this correctly, from looking
	at the kernel sources it seems ok...

Sat Mar 12 22:25:36 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* x11/display.c: Added `-name' option -- sets the name which is
	primarily used to lookup resources with.
	* x11/display.c (getxresources): If unable to find a resource with
	the program name tries with the string "Jed".

Thu Mar 10 22:08:33 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* find.c: (cmd_replace_regexp, cmd_replace_string): Checks if `pos'
	is out of range (instead of just seg-faulting).

Mon Mar	 7 21:27:25 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lispcmds.c: New symbol `lisp-lib-dir'
	* lisp.c (cmd_add_doc_string): New command to write a new doc-string
	to the DOC file and return its index.

Sun Mar	 6 12:49:38 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* windows.c (window_prin): Handles dead windows now.

	* windows.c (cmd_destroy_window): Now does (throw 'quit 0) when no
	more windows exist.
	* windows.c, amiga/windows.c: Fixed `NumWindows' variable -- it's
	now decremented in `cmd_destroy_window'.

Sat Mar	 5 01:21:35 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* edit.c: #if 0'd `stuffline'. This is now done inline where functions
	can take advantage of knowing the length of the line.

	* editcommands.c (cmd_translate_area): Applies a translation-table
	(a string) to a region of a buffer. Also, variables `upcase-table' and
	`downcase-table' are provided. Needs `cmd_translate_rect'.

Fri Mar	 4 18:55:38 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_functionp, cmd_special_form_p): Fixed null-ref
	when a symbol has no function value.

	* edit.c (rectinsertstring, rectdeletesect): Now calls the `flag*'
	functions properly. Also fixed bug that inserting past the bottom
	of the file didn't work properly.

	* files.c: Changed `cmd_find_file' to `cmd_get_file_buffer' and
	`cmd_find_buffer' to `cmd_get_buffer'.

Thu Mar	 3 21:36:01 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_eval_hook2): Could exit with `GCinhibit' still set.

	* keys.c (usekey): Now checks for a read-only buffer before inserting
	a keypress.

Mon Feb 28 19:34:54 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* symbols.c, lisp.h: New flag in Symbol struct: SF_INTERNED.
	This gets set when a symbol is interned. Lets me protect against
	interning a symbol twice.

	* streams.c (cmd_stdin_file, cmd_stdout_file): These didn't
	actually set the LFF_DONT_CLOSE flag which I had so carefully
	prepared for them :-(

Sun Feb 27 20:48:56 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* x11/windows.c (activatewin): Actually does something now -- raises
	the window and warps the mouse to it's top-left corner.

Tue Feb 22 21:58:18 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* x11/render.c (cutpastelines): Doesn't bother if `dstLine' is off
	bottom of window.

	* lisp.c, lispcmds.c, lispmach.c, ../lisp/lisp.jl: Got rid of 'lambda
	throw tag, this won't work as expected in some pieces of compiled
	code. Replaced by 'defun tag which returns a value from a defun.

Mon Feb 21 02:05:56 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lispcmds.c (cmd_load): Now takes note of variable `load-path' (list
	of directory names) and warns if compiled file is older than it's
	source. Also an option to suppress the error when file doesn't exist.

Sun Feb 20 21:20:02 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* io.c (cmd_write_buffer_area): New command, writes a portion of
	a buffer to a file.

Sat Feb 19 00:45:53 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lisp.c, lispmach.c (cmd_backtrace): Now keeps a stack of all
	living Lisp function calls. This is mainly so it's easy to see
	where an error occurs.

	* lisp.c [mainly]: Error signalling written. New subrs, signal,
	error-protect (similar to emacs' `condition-case') and a var,
	debug-on-error. New byte-opcodes introduced -- op-signal and
	op-error-protect.

Tue Feb 15 20:59:53 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* x11/render.c (cutpastelines): Some optimisation of what lines get
	moved (now leaves trailing blank lines alone).

	* unix/misc.c (cmd_user_login_name): Tries getlogin() before
	getpwuid().

Mon Feb 14 21:32:27 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* Changed doc-string handling -- now all subr doc-strings are kept in
	a separate file. All source files containg `DEFUN's have been
	changed to accomplish this and a new tool `makedoc' has been written.
	This only saves about 40K in the binary but since that was about a
	quarter of the whole size I think it's worth it.

Sat Feb 12 14:35:05 1994  J.S.Harper  (jsh@falcon.ukc.ac.uk)

	* find.c (cmd_regexp_match_line): New command, matches a regexp
	to a line of a buffer.

	* movement.c (cmd_next_tab, cmd_goto_next_tab, cmd_prev_tab,
	cmd_goto_prev_tab): These would go into a (near-)infinite loop
	when given a negative argument.

	* unix/misc.c (cmd_user_full_name): `FULL_NAME_TERMINATOR' option.

Sat Feb 12 01:28:01 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* misc.c (cmd_major_version_number, cmd_minor_version_number): New
	commands.

Thu Feb 10 03:15:12 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* render.c: '#if 0' out `cmd_refresh_window'. This isn't possible
	anymore -- there's no way of saying that a certain window has been
	updated re: a buffer while other views of that buffer haven't. This
	is no big loss, use `refresh-all' instead.

	* jed.h, x11/windowsys.h, amiga/windowsys.h: Took out most #ifdef's
	from the VW structure. Now all window-system specific bits of a VW
	are in a separate structure (`VW_WindowSystem').

Wed Feb	 9 22:46:34 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* jed.h, files.c, ../lisp/buffers.jl: Fixed problem of buffer being
	marked unmodified after an auto-save. -Introduced new field,
	`tx_ProperSaveChanges', containing the change count at the last
	time the buffer was written to its file (*not* an auto-save).

	* io.c (readtx, writetx): No longer assumes that all files end
	in '\n'. This means that files without a trailing newline don't
	get given one anyway when they're written to disk.

Tue Feb	 8 03:29:19 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* files.c (cmd_buffer_changes, cmd_buffer_modified_p,
	cmd_set_buffer_modified): New method of dealing with modification
	counts. `tx_Changes' is *never* reset -- when the buffer is
	`un-modified' another field `tx_LastSaveChanges' is set to the
	current value of `tx_Changes'. This is so the new refresh code
	can rely on the change counter.

	* render.c, x11/render.c, edit.c, editcommands.c: Rewrote functions
	which control what gets redrawn and when. This almost works. Much
	more efficient and loses some embarassing misfeatures.

Sun Feb	 6 01:25:15 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* lisp.h, streams.c: New flag in LFile structure, `LFF_DONT_CLOSE',
	means *never* fclose() the lf_File field.
	* streams.c (cmd_stdin_file, cmd_stdout_file): Access to stdin/out.
	* .gdbinit: New file, command to print a lisp object in gdb.

	* lisp.c (bindlambdalist): uses static symbols to match ampersand-
	keywords (`&optional', `&rest', `&aux').

	* amiga/misc.c: merged amiga/io.c into this file.
	* amiga/misc.c (cmd_user_login_name, cmd_user_real_name,
	cmd_user_home_directory, cmd_system_name): New commands in line
	with their unix counterparts, get their values from strategically
	placed environment variables.

	* unix/misc.c: merged unix/io.c into this file.

	* unix/io.c (cmd_user_login_name, cmd_user_real_name,
	cmd_user_home_directory, cmd_system_name): These now cache their
	results after the first time they're called.
	* unix/io.c (cmd_system_name): Now returns the full hostname, with
	domains and everything.

Sat Feb	 5 21:36:22 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* windows.c (cmd_with_window): special-form (similar to `with-buffer').
	* lispmach.c, ../lisp/compiler.jl: support for above special form, new
	opcodes `swap-window' and `windowp'.

	* lispmach.c: Put stack bounds checking inside `#ifdef PARANOID'

	* unix/processes.c (signalprocess): Signals no longer use characters.
	(Unless you define `SIGNALS_VIA_CHARS'.)

Fri Feb	 4 23:26:31 1994  John Harper  (jsh@orcrist)

	* ChangeLog starts here, I've decided to try and keep one of these
	things.
